The prologue of *The Atomic Human* by Neil D. Lawrence sets the stage for an exploration of artificial intelligence (AI) through a personal and historical lens. It opens with a vivid account of the author's participation in a pivotal moment for the field of AI: the 2013 Neural Information Processing Systems conference, where the rise of "deep learning" technology began to reshape machine learning and society at large. This event marked Facebook's strategic entry into AI with Yann LeCun's appointment to lead Facebook AI Research, signaling a shift in industry and academia.

The narrative transitions to a broader philosophical question: What is intelligence, and how does artificial intelligence compare to human intelligence? Lawrence argues that human intelligence is fundamentally constrained by our limited ability to communicate—akin to being a "butterfly within a diving suit." By contrast, machines have extraordinary communication bandwidth, sharing information at speeds millions of times faster than humans.

The prologue delves into historical and cultural contexts, comparing AI to technological milestones like the printing press and referencing mythological and artistic representations of creation, such as Michelangelo's *God and Adam* and James Cameron’s *Terminator*. Lawrence introduces the concept of "the atomic human," a theoretical indivisible essence of humanity that machines cannot replicate, and contrasts the evolving narrative of AI as both a practical tool and a reflection of human aspirations.

In conclusion, the prologue positions *The Atomic Human* as a reflective journey to understand AI not merely as a technological phenomenon but as a mirror to human intelligence and society. It invites readers to consider the potential and challenges of AI while seeking insights into our collective identity and future.
