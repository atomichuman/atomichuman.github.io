### Summary

Chapter 7, *It’s Not Rocket Science or Brain Surgery*, examines the interplay of human and machine intelligence, with a focus on the balance between automated systems and human intervention. Drawing on the Apollo moon landing as a case study, the chapter explores the importance of reflexive and reflective systems in decision-making and control.

The chapter opens by challenging the common metaphors of "rocket science" and "brain surgery," arguing that both oversimplify the intricate systems of control and decision-making involved in space missions. For instance, Neil Armstrong’s manual intervention during the Apollo 11 landing exemplifies how human reflexes and judgment complement automated systems. Armstrong’s success depended not only on advanced technology but also on the precise motor control developed through years of training.

Human motor intelligence, the chapter argues, emerges from the co-evolution of nerves, muscles, and bones. It is a product of countless generations of adaptation and training, which allows humans to perform complex tasks like cycling or piloting spacecraft. This motor intelligence often operates below conscious awareness, resembling the automated feedback loops in mechanical systems such as Watt’s governor.

The chapter contrasts these human capabilities with machine intelligence, highlighting the limitations of automation in contexts requiring adaptability and nuance. While computers like the Apollo Guidance Computer excelled in calculations, their "fast-reacting systems" were still dependent on human oversight for critical decisions.

By analyzing historical advancements in automation, such as the Apollo mission’s development of Mission Control, the chapter underscores the importance of integrating human culture, training, and intelligence into systems of automation. These collaborations enable achievements far beyond the capacity of machines or humans alone.
