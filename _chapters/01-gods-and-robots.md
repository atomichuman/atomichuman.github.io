### Summary

Chapter 1, *Gods and Robots*, juxtaposes two iconic representations of creation: Michelangelo’s depiction of God giving life to Adam in the Sistine Chapel and James Cameron’s Terminator, a machine designed to extinguish human life. These contrasting images embody different facets of intelligence and creation, one divine and the other artificial. The chapter explores how these representations reflect human fascination with intelligence—natural and synthetic.

The narrative delves into the concept of the "embodiment factor," which refers to the interplay between computational and communication abilities in defining intelligence. Human intelligence is constrained by our biological embodiment, limiting our communication bandwidth. Machines, by contrast, excel in communication, sharing vast amounts of data at incredible speeds, a feat humans can only dream of.

Through historical parallels, such as the printing press automating text reproduction and the Protestant Reformation it indirectly sparked, the chapter contextualizes artificial intelligence as the next step in humanity’s quest for automation. AI, however, automates decision-making, unblocking the bottleneck of human cognitive choices and challenging notions of human uniqueness.

The chapter closes with a reflection on myths like Frankenstein and the Golem, which caution against hubris in creation. These narratives are reframed as allegories for humanity's relationship with its tools, revealing both fear and hope for a future shared with artificial intelligences.
