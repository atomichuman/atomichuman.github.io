### Summary

Intent defines the purpose behind actions or decisions, shaping how knowledge is used and applied. While humans imbue decisions with intent rooted in values and goals, AI often lacks this layer of understanding, operating purely on programmed objectives. This reflection explores the importance of intent in bridging the gap between knowledge and meaningful action, emphasizing its role in ethical and effective decision-making.
