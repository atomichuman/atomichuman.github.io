### Summary

Surveillance has long been a tool of power, used to control, influence, and manipulate individuals and societies. From the Stasiâ€™s oppressive monitoring in East Germany to the pervasive data collection by modern tech companies, this theme explores the tension between security and autonomy. It highlights how unchecked surveillance can amplify societal divisions, erode trust, and concentrate power, emphasizing the need for ethical boundaries and robust governance in the age of artificial intelligence.
