### Summary

The embodiment factor refers to the interplay between computational power and communication ability in defining intelligence. Humans, constrained by their biological form, exhibit a high ratio of thought to communication, which influences how intelligence manifests. Machines, by contrast, operate without such constraints, allowing for seamless, high-bandwidth interactions. This disparity shapes the roles humans and machines play in decision-making, creativity, and societal functions, highlighting the unique strengths of embodied human intelligence.
