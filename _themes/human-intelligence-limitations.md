### Summary

Human intelligence is bound by inherent limitations, including the "locked-in" nature of our cognitive and communicative abilities. While our brains possess immense power for thought and creativity, the bandwidth of our communication is constrained, creating a bottleneck in how ideas and knowledge are shared. These constraints define our individual and collective potential but also highlight the unique adaptability of human intelligence in overcoming environmental and social challenges.
