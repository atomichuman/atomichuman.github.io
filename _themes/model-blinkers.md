## Machine Summary

"Model Blinkers" emerges as a crucial concept in *The Atomic Human*, describing how theoretical models and paradigms can limit our ability to see beyond established frameworks, particularly in scientific and technological development.

### Origins and Definition

The concept is most explicitly developed in [Chapter 10](/chapters/10-gaslighting/), using examples from physics history to show how established models can restrict thinking:
- Planck and Einstein's quantum mechanics discoveries challenged classical physics
- Established scientists often struggled to accept new paradigms
- The term describes how theoretical frameworks can act like horse blinkers, narrowing perception

### Blake's Newton and Visual Metaphor

William Blake's [image of Newton](/images/william-blake-newton/) provides a powerful visual metaphor for model blinkers:
- Shows Newton focused intently on geometric measurements
- Depicts him turning his back on the rich, colorful world behind him
- Illustrates how mathematical models can blind us to broader reality
- Captures tension between reductionist precision and holistic understanding

### Relation to Theory-Induced Blindness

While related to Kahneman's concept of theory-induced blindness, model blinkers differs in key ways:
- Theory-induced blindness describes inability to see flaws in theories we've mastered
- Model blinkers emphasizes how frameworks actively restrict our peripheral vision
- Kahneman focuses on individual cognitive bias
- Model blinkers addresses systematic limitations in scientific/technical approaches

### Historical Examples

The book traces this phenomenon through several contexts:
- Early AI's focus on logic and rules ([Chapter 3](/chapters/03-intent/))
- Weather prediction models' limitations ([Chapter 6](/chapters/06-the-gremlin-of-uncertainty/))
- Apollo program's engineering challenges ([Chapter 7](/chapters/07-its-not-rocket-science-or-brain-surgery/))
- Early brain modeling attempts ([Chapter 9](/chapters/09-a-design-for-a-brain/))

### Modern Manifestations

Current examples of model blinkers include:
- Over-reliance on digital computing paradigms
- Narrow focus on data-driven approaches
- Assumption that intelligence requires centralized control
- Belief in universal optimization principles

### Implications for AI

The concept has particular relevance for artificial intelligence:
- Warns against assuming human-like intelligence is the only form
- Questions whether neural networks truly mirror brain function
- Challenges assumption that more data always leads to better results
- Suggests need for multiple approaches rather than single paradigms

### Breaking Free

The book suggests several approaches to overcome model blinkers:
- Embracing diverse perspectives and approaches
- Recognizing limitations of current models
- Maintaining openness to paradigm shifts
- Supporting institutional diversity in research
- Encouraging cross-disciplinary dialogue

This theme emphasizes how awareness of model blinkers is crucial for avoiding technological tunnel vision and maintaining genuine innovation.
