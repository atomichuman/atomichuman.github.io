### Summary

Goethe’s *The Sorcerer’s Apprentice* serves as a cautionary tale about the perils of wielding power without understanding or control. This reflection examines how the story parallels humanity’s relationship with technology, particularly artificial intelligence. It emphasizes the importance of oversight, humility, and ethical responsibility to prevent unintended consequences when deploying powerful systems.
