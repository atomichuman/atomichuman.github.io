### Summary

Reflexive intelligence operates instinctively, responding to stimuli with speed and efficiency, while reflective intelligence involves deliberate thought, weighing context and long-term implications. This theme contrasts the fast, automatic processes in artificial systems, like supply chain algorithms, with the slower, more nuanced decision-making of humans. It underscores the need for balance between these modes of intelligence, particularly in systems designed to impact human lives and societies.
