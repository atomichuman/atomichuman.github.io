## Machine Summary

"Affordances" describes the latent possibilities for action or meaning that emerge from the relationship between an agent and properties of their environment, whether physical, digital, social or linguistic [Chemero (2003)](/bibliography/an-outline-theory-of-affordances). In *The Atomic Human*, this concept provides a crucial framework for understanding how intelligence emerges from the interaction between agents and their environment [Gibson (1979)](/bibliography/the-ecological-approach-to-visual-perception), with particular focus on the differences between human and artificial intelligence [Norman (1988)](/bibliography/the-psychology-of-everyday-things).

### Relationality

The relationality of affordances - that they emerge from interaction rather than existing solely in agent or environment - appears throughout the book:
- Bauby's "diving bell" metaphor shows how intelligence emerges from interaction between mind and environment [Chapter 1](/chapters/01-gods-and-robots)
- Test pilots developing "feel" for aircraft through direct experience [Chapter 6](/chapters/06-the-gremlin-of-uncertainty)
- O'Regan's sensorimotor approach to perception [Chapter 8](/chapters/08-system-zero)
- The essential role of cultural context in human intelligence [Chapter 5](/chapters/05-enlightenment)

This relational view helps explain why simply replicating human behaviors in machines fails to capture true intelligence.

### Potentiality 

The concept of potentiality - that affordances represent possibilities that may or may not be realized - appears in discussions of:
- System Zero exploiting latent human vulnerabilities [Chapter 8](/chapters/08-system-zero)
- How cultural artifacts create possibilities for action across time [Chapter 4](/chapters/04-persistence)
- The way HAMs learn patterns without understanding underlying potential [Chapter 11](/chapters/11-human-analogue-machines)
- Evolution's exploration of possibility spaces versus designed solutions [Chapter 4](/chapters/04-persistence)

This highlights how human intelligence engages with possibility while machines operate on predetermined patterns.

### Constraint

The book examines constraints - how affordances are bounded by properties of both environment and agent:
- Human communication bandwidth limitations [Chapter 1](/chapters/01-gods-and-robots)
- The "affordance gap" between human and machine capabilities [Chapter 11](/chapters/11-human-analogue-machines)
- How cultural context both enables and limits human action [Chapter 5](/chapters/05-enlightenment)
- Physical and computational constraints on artificial systems [Chapter 6](/chapters/06-the-gremlin-of-uncertainty)

Understanding these constraints helps explain fundamental differences between evolved and designed intelligence.

### Implications

These three aspects of affordances - *relationality*, *potentiality*, and *constraint* - illuminate key themes:
- Why human intelligence can't be reduced to computation alone
- How System Zero exploits human affordances for manipulation 
- The importance of maintaining appropriate human-machine interfaces
- Why diverse perspectives are crucial for technological development

The affordance framework helps explain both the power and limitations of artificial intelligence while highlighting the unique characteristics of human intelligence that emerge from our evolved relationship with the world.
