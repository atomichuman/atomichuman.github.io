### Summary

Homeostasis and adaptation are key principles in both biological and artificial systems. Inspired by W. Ross Ashbyâ€™s theories, this theme explores how systems maintain equilibrium in changing environments. In humans, the brain and body adapt to ensure survival through dynamic feedback mechanisms. In artificial systems, adaptation takes the form of machine learning and algorithmic updates. This theme highlights the parallels between these processes and emphasizes the importance of flexibility and resilience in intelligence.
