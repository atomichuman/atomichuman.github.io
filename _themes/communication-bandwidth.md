### Summary

Communication bandwidth refers to the rate at which humans and machines can share information. While machines can transmit billions of bits per second, humans are far slower, limited by physical constraints such as speech, writing, or winking in extreme cases like locked-in syndrome. This disparity creates a fundamental distinction between human and machine intelligence, emphasizing how humans rely on context, cultural understanding, and shared experiences to overcome these limitations and effectively convey meaning.
