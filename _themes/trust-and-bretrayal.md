### Summary

Trust is a foundational element of human relationships, but it also represents a vulnerability that can be exploited. From personal betrayals, such as Vera Lengsfeld's experiences with the Stasi, to systemic manipulations like those revealed in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, this theme examines how trust can be undermined. It also highlights the importance of transparency, accountability, and shared values in maintaining trust amidst the growing influence of artificial intelligence and algorithmic systems.
