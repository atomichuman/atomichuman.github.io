### Summary

Reflexive systems, both biological and artificial, rely on training to achieve precision and responsiveness. This reflection examines how feedback loops and repetition shape reflexive behavior, from neural pathways in humans to algorithms in machines. It highlights the role of structured training environments in refining these systems while emphasizing the limitations of reflexive intelligence in addressing complex, context-driven challenges.
