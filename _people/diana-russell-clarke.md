### Summary

Diana Russell Clarke was a member of the team of "human computers" who worked at Bletchley Park during World War II. Her meticulous calculations played a critical role in the manual decoding processes that supported the cryptanalytic efforts against German ciphers. Clarke’s work exemplifies the precision and dedication of the human operators whose efforts prefigured the development of automated computing systems. 

In *The Atomic Human*, Clarke is highlighted as part of the foundational story of computing, illustrating the transition from manual computation to machine-assisted processing. Her contributions underscore the interplay between human ingenuity and the emerging technologies that redefined the limits of problem-solving.

Clarke’s story serves as a tribute to the often-overlooked individuals whose painstaking efforts laid the groundwork for modern computational systems, aligning with the book’s broader exploration of humanity’s role in shaping and collaborating with machines.

Diana has a [memorial bench in Burford](https://openbenches.org/bench/14704).
