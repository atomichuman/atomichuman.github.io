### Summary

Jonathan Price, a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers specializing in digital media law, has been a profound influence on *The Atomic Human* from its earliest conception. His relationship with the author dates back to childhood, and this personal connection has enabled uniquely candid discussions about the intersection of technology and law that would eventually shape the book's core ideas.

The book's origins can be traced to collaborative conversations between Price and the author at the Fork Deli near Bloomsbury Square, where they explored the legal and technical dimensions of emerging technologies. Price's philosophical background, particularly his introduction of Popper's works to the author, has left an indelible mark on the book's theoretical framework. His gift of "Conjectures and Refutations" proved particularly influential in shaping the book's epistemological foundations.

Price's expertise in digital media law, demonstrated through his participation in key events such as the 2016 DALI meeting on machine learning and society and the UCL debate on AI ethics, ~~brings crucial~~ [brought early] legal perspective[s] to the book's examination of technological change. His early collaboration on the first draft reflects the book's commitment to bridging technical and legal understanding in addressing contemporary challenges of the digital age.
