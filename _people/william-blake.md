### Summary

William Blake appears in The Atomic Human as both artist and prophet, whose work provides crucial imagery and insights about the relationship between human creativity and mechanical reasoning. His art and poetry serve as counterpoints to the mechanical worldview of the Industrial Revolution.

Key appearances in the book include:

- **Newton (Chapter 5):** His famous painting of Newton shows the scientist bent over his compass, symbolizing the limitations of pure mathematical reasoning. The book uses this image to critique overly reductionist approaches to understanding intelligence.

- **Elohim Creating Adam (Chapter 5):** This artwork is contrasted with Michelangelo's Creation of Adam, helping explore themes about embodied intelligence and the relationship between mind and body. The book uses this to discuss how intelligence emerges from physical interaction with the environment.

- **The Tyger (Chapter 5):** His poem appears alongside discussions of Watt's steam engine and the Industrial Revolution, helping illustrate the tension between mechanical and natural forms of creation and intelligence.

In The Atomic Human, Blake serves as a visionary voice warning about the limitations of purely mechanical or mathematical approaches to understanding. His artistic work provides powerful visual metaphors for the book's key themes about the nature of intelligence and the risks of reducing human understanding to pure logic or computation.

Blake's criticism of the "dark Satanic Mills" of industrialization parallels modern concerns about artificial intelligence and automation. The book uses his perspective to highlight how questions about human agency and mechanical control have deep historical roots in the Industrial Revolution.

His integration of art, poetry, and prophecy also helps illustrate the book's argument that human intelligence encompasses more than just logical reasoning, involving creativity, intuition, and emotional understanding that cannot be reduced to computational processes.
