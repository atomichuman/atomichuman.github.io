### Summary

W. Ross Ashby was a British cyberneticist and a pioneer in systems theory whose groundbreaking work laid the foundation for understanding complex systems. Best known for concepts such as the "Law of Requisite Variety" and the "Homeostat," Ashby contributed significantly to the fields of cybernetics, artificial intelligence, and systems design. His theories emphasized the importance of adaptability and feedback mechanisms in maintaining stability within dynamic environments.

In *The Atomic Human*, Ashby’s ideas are invoked to frame the relationship between human intelligence and artificial systems. His concept of requisite variety, which posits that a system must have sufficient internal diversity to respond to external changes, serves as a key metaphor in the book’s exploration of human adaptability in the face of advancing AI. Ashby’s work bridges the gap between theoretical principles and practical applications, offering a lens through which to examine the evolving role of technology in society.

By drawing on Ashby’s legacy, Neil D. Lawrence underscores the enduring relevance of systems thinking in addressing the challenges of the AI age. Ashby’s contributions remind readers that the interplay between complexity and control remains central to both understanding and shaping our future.
