### Summary

Alan Turing appears throughout The Atomic Human as a pivotal figure who bridges multiple themes of the book - from early computing and artificial intelligence to the deeply human aspects of intelligence and social interaction.

Key appearances in the book include:

- **Codebreaking at Bletchley Park (Chapter 2):** Turing's work on the Enigma machine demonstrates early automated decision-making, showing how complex problems could be broken down into computable components while still requiring human judgment.

- **Universal Computation (Chapter 5):** His theoretical work on universal computation laid foundations for modern computing, though the book emphasizes how his vision went beyond pure logic to include learning and adaptation.

- **Social Intelligence (Chapter 9):** The book uses Turing's personal story - his love of running, social challenges, and tragic end - to explore the difference between technical and social forms of intelligence. His interest in telepathy is used to examine how humans actually communicate through social cues rather than direct mind-reading.

- **Neural Networks (Chapter 9):** His correspondence with W. Ross Ashby about brain simulation and neural networks shows early thinking about how machines might learn rather than just compute.

In The Atomic Human, Turing emerges as a complex figure whose work and life illustrate both the potential and limitations of artificial intelligence. His persecution for his sexuality and subsequent death are presented as a tragic example of society's failure to embrace human difference, while his scientific legacy demonstrates the enduring challenge of creating machines that can truly communicate and understand like humans do.

His contributions to multiple fields - from theoretical computer science to artificial intelligence to mathematical biology - exemplify the book's broader argument about the diverse nature of intelligence and the importance of both technical and social understanding in human cognition.
