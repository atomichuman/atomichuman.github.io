### Summary

Jack Garman was a NASA engineer and a critical figure in the Apollo 11 Moon landing. At just 25 years old, Garman resolved a critical "Error Code 1202" from the lunar module's guidance computer moments before landing, enabling the mission to continue successfully. This decision required him to trust the computer’s ability to prioritize essential tasks despite encountering an *Executive Overload*. His quick judgment, made within three seconds, ensured Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin could safely touch down on the lunar surface.

In *The Atomic Human*, Neil D. Lawrence uses Garman’s role to highlight the interplay between different speeds and levels of decision-making. Garman’s split-second choice is likened to reflexive intelligence, akin to the brain’s instinctive response to imminent danger. Meanwhile, the simulations and training that prepared Garman and Mission Control for such moments are compared to reflective processes, emphasizing the importance of a hierarchical approach to decision-making under uncertainty.

Garman’s actions exemplify the integration of human expertise and machine precision, showing how these two elements complement each other in solving complex problems. His legacy in the book underscores the necessity of balancing fast-reacting systems with slower, reflective strategies, a theme central to the narrative’s exploration of intelligence.

**Additional Context:** This updated description acknowledges that Garman’s story in *The Atomic Human* is used to explore the interplay between reflexive and reflective intelligence, rather than solely focusing on his [human oversight] ~quick decision-making~. My initial draft mischaracterized this emphasis, which was clarified after revisiting the text.
