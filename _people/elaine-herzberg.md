### Summary

Elaine Herzberg was a pedestrian whose tragic death in 2018 marked the first fatality involving a fully autonomous vehicle. She was struck by a self-driving Uber in Tempe, Arizona, when the vehicle's AI system failed to classify her correctly. The system oscillated between identifying her as a vehicle, "other," or a bicycle, failing to respond in time to prevent the collision. Herzberg’s death brought global attention to the vulnerabilities of autonomous systems and the ethical challenges surrounding their deployment.
