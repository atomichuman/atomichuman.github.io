### Summary

Leibniz appears in The Atomic Human as a visionary figure whose ideas about universal calculation and logical reasoning prefigured modern computing and artificial intelligence. His concept of the calculus ratiocinator particularly serves as an early dream of mechanical reasoning.

Key appearances in the book include:

- **Calculus Ratiocinator ([Chapter 5](/chapters/05-enlightenment/)):** His vision of a universal calculating machine that could resolve all disputes through computation is presented as an early precursor to ideas about artificial intelligence. The book uses this to explore enduring dreams and limitations of mechanical reasoning.

- **Calculus Controversy ([Chapter 5](/chapters/05-enlightenment/)):** His parallel development of calculus with Newton helps illustrate the book's themes about multiple discovery and how ideas emerge from cultural context rather than individual genius.

- **Universal Computation ([Chapter 5](/chapters/05-enlightenment/)):** His ideas about a universal symbolic language for reasoning help establish intellectual foundations that would later enable computer science and digital logic.

In *The Atomic Human*, Leibniz represents an important bridge between philosophical dreams of perfect mechanical reasoning and modern artificial intelligence. His calculus ratiocinator serves as an early version of what would later become universal computation and AI.

The book uses Leibniz's work to explore how long-standing dreams of mechanical reasoning persist in modern AI development. His vision of reducing reasoning to calculation exemplifies both the ambitions and limitations of purely logical approaches to intelligence.

His contentious relationship with Newton over calculus also helps illustrate the book's broader themes about how knowledge develops through cultural and social processes rather than just individual invention.
