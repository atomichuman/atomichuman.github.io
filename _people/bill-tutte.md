### Summary

Bill Tutte was a British mathematician whose extraordinary work during World War II played a crucial role in the development of modern computing and cryptography. In *The Atomic Human*, Tutte is introduced as a symbol of pure intellectual creativity and determination. His reverse-engineering of the Lorenz cipher—a machine he never saw—demonstrated the power of abstract reasoning and innovation in solving complex, high-stakes problems. 

The book uses Tutte’s story to illustrate a key theme: the synergy between human ingenuity and emerging technologies. His breakthroughs in deciphering the Lorenz cipher directly influenced the design of Colossus, the world’s first programmable digital computer. Tutte’s work is framed as a cornerstone in the transition from manual to machine-assisted problem-solving, reflecting the early fusion of human cognition and computational logic.

Through Tutte, *The Atomic Human* explores the broader implications of humanity’s unique ability to conceptualize and build systems that surpass the limitations of individual effort, while emphasizing the collaborative and iterative nature of technological progress.
