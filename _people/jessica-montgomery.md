### Summary

Jessica Montgomery is a policy expert and research leader whose work spans the intersection of technology, governance, and society. Her career trajectory reflects the evolving landscape of AI policy and data governance. Beginning as a Clerk in the House of Commons, where she contributed to crucial investigations including the 2015 Select Committee on the Horizon software system, Montgomery developed deep expertise in technology policy and its societal implications.

In *The Atomic Human*, Montgomery's influence is evident through her leadership at the Royal Society, where she played a pivotal role in shaping AI policy discourse. Her stewardship of the Chicheley Manor meeting, a key moment referenced in the book, exemplifies her ability to bridge technical and policy communities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, her work at the Royal Society further demonstrated the critical importance of data-driven policy making in crisis response.

Montgomery's subsequent roles, including ~~leading~~ [directing] the [Accelerate Science Programme](/initiatives/accelerate-science/) at Cambridge University and serving as a founding member of the [Data Trusts Initiative](/initiatives/data-trusts-initiative/), reflect the book's themes of responsible innovation and institutional adaptation to technological change. As director of ai@cam, she continues to shape the dialogue between AI research, policy, and societal impact, embodying the book's emphasis on thoughtful governance of emerging technologies.
