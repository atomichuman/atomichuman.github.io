### Summary

Matthew Boulton appears in The Atomic Human as a key figure in the Industrial Revolution whose partnership with James Watt produced crucial innovations in automated control systems. His story helps illustrate the historical roots of modern automation and artificial intelligence.

Key appearances in the book include:

- **The Albion Mill (Chapter 5):** The book describes Boulton's Albion Mill on the Thames as a pivotal site where the fly-ball governor mechanism was implemented, representing an early form of automated control. This serves as a crucial example of mechanical intelligence and feedback systems.

- **Industrial Innovation (Chapter 5):** His partnership with James Watt demonstrates how industrial innovation emerged from combining theoretical understanding with practical engineering. The Soho manufactory becomes a symbol of the transformation from craft production to industrial automation.

- **Automated Control (Chapter 5):** The fly-ball governor developed at his facilities becomes a recurring metaphor throughout the book for understanding how automated systems can exhibit intelligent behavior through feedback mechanisms.

In The Atomic Human, Boulton represents an important historical bridge between the Enlightenment's theoretical advances and practical technological implementation. His role in developing early automated control systems helps establish a historical continuity between mechanical automation and modern artificial intelligence.

The book uses Boulton's story to illustrate how questions about automation and control have deep historical roots, predating modern computers and AI. His work with Watt on the steam engine and governor mechanism demonstrates how even early automated systems required balancing control with adaptation to changing conditions - a challenge that remains relevant in modern AI systems.

Boulton's example also helps illustrate the book's broader themes about the relationship between human and machine intelligence, showing how automated systems have long complemented rather than replaced human capabilities.
