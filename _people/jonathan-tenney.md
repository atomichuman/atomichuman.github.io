## Overview

Jonathan Tenney is an Assistant Professor in Assyriology at the University of Cambridge. He specializes in translating and analyzing Babylonian cuneiform tablets, combining traditional archaeological methods with modern computational tools to explore ancient social networks.

## Contributions

- **Cuneiform Translation:** Translated Babylonian tablet UET 7, 0011, shedding light on early data systems.
- **Machine Learning in Archaeology:** Developed tools to cluster and visualize relationships between historical records, advancing Assyriological research.
- **AI Integration in Humanities:** Designed workflows that use AI to enhance qualitative data interpretation.

## Role in *The Atomic Human*

In *The Atomic Human*, Tenney's work is highlighted in Chapter 11, *Humanâ€“Analogue Machines*. His translations of cuneiform tablets demonstrate parallels between ancient and modern systems of data processing. The book draws on his insights to illustrate how early record-keeping practices laid the foundation for contemporary AI technologies.
