### Summary

Norbert Wiener was an American mathematician and the founder of cybernetics, a field that explores the relationships between systems, control, and communication in machines, animals, and humans. His pioneering work, particularly through his book *Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine* (1948), shaped the theoretical foundations of modern computing, automation, and artificial intelligence.

In *The Atomic Human*, Wiener’s ideas are central to understanding how machines and humans interact and influence one another. His exploration of feedback loops and system regulation provides a framework for discussing the ethical and philosophical implications of AI. Wiener emphasized the potential for machines to augment human capabilities while warning of the societal risks of unchecked technological development, themes that resonate deeply throughout the book.

Wiener’s legacy in *The Atomic Human* serves as both a guiding light and a cautionary tale, illustrating the transformative power of cybernetics while reminding readers of the responsibility that comes with creating intelligent systems. His insights underscore the book's focus on how humanity can navigate the challenges of an increasingly automated and interconnected world.
