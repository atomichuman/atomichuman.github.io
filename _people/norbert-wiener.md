### Summary

Norbert Wiener was an American mathematician and the founder of cybernetics, a field that explores the relationships between systems, control, and communication in machines, animals, and humans. His pioneering work, particularly through his book *Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine* (1948), shaped the theoretical foundations of modern computing, automation, and artificial intelligence.

In *The Atomic Human*, Wiener’s contributions are explored in several key contexts:

- **The Gremlin of Uncertainty (Chapter 7):** Wiener’s work on stochastic processes and his concept of the "family of curves" are used to discuss strategies for managing uncertainty and making predictions in complex systems, such as artillery trajectories. This highlights Wiener’s focus on probabilistic rather than deterministic approaches.

- **Cybernetics and Feedback (Chapter 9):** Wiener’s development of cybernetics is tied to the concept of feedback loops, emphasizing intelligence as an emergent property of systems interacting dynamically with their environments.

- **The Theory of Ignorance (Chapter 11):** Wiener’s ideas on the limits of human cognition and his "theory of ignorance" are discussed in contrast to Bertrand Russell’s rigid logical frameworks. Lawrence uses Wiener’s work to highlight the importance of probabilistic thinking and adaptability in dealing with complex, unpredictable systems.

- **Influence on AI (Various Chapters):** Wiener’s foundational ideas for artificial intelligence are discussed alongside his collaborations and disagreements with contemporaries like Alan Turing and Claude Shannon. His skepticism of deterministic AI models underscores the need for adaptability and uncertainty in intelligent systems.

Wiener’s work in *The Atomic Human* serves as a recurring reference point for understanding how human and machine intelligences cope with complexity, adaptability, and uncertainty. His legacy emphasizes the importance of systems thinking and probabilistic reasoning in navigating an increasingly automated world.
