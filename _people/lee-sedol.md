### Summary

Lee Sedol is a South Korean Go champion renowned for his 18 world titles and his historic matches against Google DeepMind’s AI, AlphaGo, in 2016. Although AlphaGo won the series 4–1, Lee Sedol’s victory in the fourth game became a defining moment in *The Atomic Human*. By exposing a flaw in AlphaGo’s neural network—a gap later termed a *Sedolian void*—he demonstrated the unique creativity and adaptability of human intelligence in navigating uncharted territories.

In *The Atomic Human*, Neil D. Lawrence celebrates Lee Sedol’s triumph as a testament to human ingenuity and the ability to confront uncertainty with creativity. This contrasts with the broader narrative of the AlphaGo matches, which often frames the event as a milestone in AI’s dominance over human strategic thinking. The book highlights Sedol’s ability to exploit these voids, underscoring the importance of intuition and insight in areas where machines remain limited. While AlphaGo quickly adapted by simulating games to fill the void, Sedol’s moment of brilliance symbolizes the enduring power of human innovation.

Lee Sedol’s story in the book is a reminder that while AI may excel in speed and iteration, humanity’s capacity for imagination and adaptability remains unparalleled. His victory is framed not as a fleeting success, but as a powerful counterpoint to AI’s perceived superiority.

**Additional Context:** This description was updated to emphasize *The Atomic Human*’s narrative framing of Lee Sedol’s victory as a celebration of human ingenuity, contrasting it with the wider narrative that views the AlphaGo matches as an AI triumph.
