### Summary

Karl Popper was a 20th-century philosopher of science renowned for his contributions to the philosophy of critical rationalism and his defense of liberal democracy. His works, particularly *Conjectures and Refutations* and *The Open Society and Its Enemies*, are pivotal to the themes explored in *The Atomic Human*. 

In the book, Popper’s ideas appear in several contexts:

- **Conjectures and Refutations (Chapter 9):** Lawrence uses Popper’s model of scientific evolution—where hypotheses are tested and refined through iterative cycles—to explore how intelligence co-evolves with its environment. Popper’s metaphor of the chicken and the egg adapting together becomes a central analogy for understanding the feedback loops between systems and their contexts&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

- **The Open Society and Its Enemies (Epilogue):** Popper’s advocacy for open societies and criticism of authoritarianism is used to critique the concentration of power in modern tech companies. The book draws on his ideas to argue for collaboration and institutional checks on AI development to prevent monopolization of influence and the erosion of democratic values&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

- **Empowering Social Engineers (Epilogue):** Lawrence adopts Popper’s call for "piecemeal social engineers" to propose a balanced approach to AI governance, emphasizing the importance of involving diverse voices and institutional frameworks to steer technological development responsibly&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

Popper’s philosophy serves as a guiding thread in *The Atomic Human*, offering a lens to examine the iterative, collaborative processes needed to govern AI ethically and effectively. His ideas underscore the importance of adaptability, institutional oversight, and humility in addressing the complex challenges posed by intelligent systems.

**Additional Context:** This updated summary reflects the accurate placement of Popper’s references in the text. The earlier version mistakenly connected Popper to Chapter 10, which required further prompting to confirm his ~~primary~~ [only] appearances in Chapters 9 and the Epilogue.
