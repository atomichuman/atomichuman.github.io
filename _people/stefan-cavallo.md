### Summary

Stefan Cavallo appears in The Atomic Human as a crucial example of how human expertise develops through direct experience with uncertainty. His experiences as a test pilot for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) help illustrate key concepts about human judgment and decision-making under pressure.

Key appearances in the book include:

- **Test Pilot Experience (Chapter 6):** His encounters with "jerk forces" in the P-51 Mustang demonstrate how direct experience with uncertainty shapes expertise. The book uses his story to explain how humans develop intuitive understanding of complex systems.

- **Written Documentation (Chapter 6):** His detailed written account "Bailout" serves as an example of how human expertise can be partially, but never fully, captured in documentation. This illustrates the limitations of trying to fully codify human knowledge.

- **Career Choices (Chapter 7):** Unlike Chuck Yeager, Cavallo chose to return to his family business rather than continue test flying at Muroc. This personal decision helps illustrate how human choices involve complex social and emotional factors beyond pure technical considerations.

In The Atomic Human, Cavallo's experiences serve as a bridge between theoretical understanding and practical expertise. His story helps demonstrate how human intelligence develops through direct physical interaction with uncertain environments, contrasting with purely theoretical or computational approaches.

The book uses Cavallo's experiences to explore broader themes about the nature of expertise, showing how human intelligence emerges from the combination of theoretical knowledge with direct physical experience. His story helps illustrate why certain aspects of human expertise remain difficult to replicate in artificial systems.
