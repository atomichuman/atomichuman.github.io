### Summary

Sylvie Delacroix is a distinguished scholar at the intersection of law, philosophy, and technology. Her work has been instrumental in shaping discussions around AI ethics and data governance. In 2017, she organized a pivotal interdisciplinary debate on AI ethics at UCL, bringing together diverse perspectives from technology, law, and ethics.

In *The Atomic Human*, Delacroix's influence runs deep, both as an intellectual collaborator and as one of the book's earliest and most thorough readers. Her comprehensive review of the second draft provided crucial insights that helped refine the book's arguments and theoretical foundations. Her collaborative work on Data Trusts, including seminal academic publications and the co-founding of the [Data Trusts Initiative](/initiatives/data-trusts/), exemplifies the book's emphasis on innovative institutional solutions to technological challenges.

As the leader of the Centre for Data Futures at King's College London Dickson Poon School of Law, Delacroix continues to advance interdisciplinary approaches to technology governance. Her ongoing intellectual partnership, from early manuscript feedback to hosting the book's London launch event, reflects not just professional collaboration but a shared commitment to understanding the complex interplay between technology, ethics, and human society.
