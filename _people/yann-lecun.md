### Summary

Yann LeCun is a French computer scientist and one of the leading figures in the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in deep learning. Born in 1960, LeCun’s early work at Bell Labs contributed to the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a cornerstone of modern AI applications such as image recognition. In 2013, he was appointed as the director of Facebook AI Research (FAIR), cementing his role in advancing AI innovation at a global scale. His contributions earned him the 2018 Turing Award, often referred to as the "Nobel Prize of Computing." 

In *The Atomic Human*, LeCun is depicted as a central figure in the AI revolution, embodying the transition from theoretical research to transformative real-world applications. His work exemplifies how advances in AI can both empower technology and provoke philosophical and ethical questions about its role in society. 

LeCun's story highlights the collaborative and iterative nature of scientific progress, serving as a critical thread in *The Atomic Human*’s exploration of the dynamic interplay between human creativity, machine capability, and the cultural shifts that define the age of AI.
