### Summary

Samuel Butler appears in The Atomic Human primarily through his prescient 1863 letter to the editor "Darwin among the machines," which serves as a crucial early warning about artificial intelligence and automation. His work bridges Victorian-era concerns about industrialization with modern anxieties about AI.

Key appearances in the book include:

- **Evolution of Machines (Chapter 4):** Butler's letter warning about machine evolution is presented as an early recognition that machines might develop through a process parallel to biological evolution. The book uses this to explore differences between natural and artificial selection.

- **Industrial Revolution Context (Chapter 5):** His writing provides historical context for understanding how the Industrial Revolution was perceived by contemporaries, particularly the fear that machines might eventually supersede humans.

- **Technological Anxiety (Chapter 11):** Butler's concerns about machine evolution are revisited in discussions of modern AI, showing how his Victorian-era warnings about mechanical consciousness parallel current debates about artificial intelligence.

Butler's role in The Atomic Human is particularly significant as he represents an early voice recognizing both the potential and dangers of technological evolution. His work connects the book's themes about natural versus artificial intelligence, the role of evolution in developing intelligence, and societal concerns about automation.

The book uses Butler's writings to demonstrate how concerns about artificial intelligence predate modern computers, suggesting that these anxieties reflect fundamental questions about human uniqueness and our relationship with our technological creations. His inclusion helps establish a historical continuity in debates about machine intelligence while highlighting how these discussions often reflect deeper cultural anxieties about human identity and agency.
