  On November 11th 2021 we had our first Accelerate Science summit. Alongside keynotes we had unworkshops on different topics. An unworkshop on challenges for AI in science and maths explored how different disciplines are leveraging data types to enable research â€“ from string theory to computational biology. While coming from different disciplinary perspectives, researchers often have shared challenges in dealing with highly multidimensional data, and in integrating data from across different scales or data sources.
