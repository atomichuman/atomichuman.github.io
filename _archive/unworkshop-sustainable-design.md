  On November 11th 2021 we had our first Accelerate Science summit. Alongside keynotes we had unworkshops on different topics. In a session on sustainability, we heard how AI can be used to support the design of complex building structures with a lower environmental footprint, the creation of novel biomaterials that can be used in sustainable construction, and the development of more effective policy interventions to encourage low-carbon behaviours.
