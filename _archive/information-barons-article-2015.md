## Article Analysis and Historical Context

The article appeared in late 2015 during a period of major data breaches in the UK, including TalkTalk and Carphone Warehouse. It made several key arguments:

1. Data Control and Power
- Drew parallels between medieval feudal structures and modern tech companies
- Warned about emergence of "digital serfdom" through corporate data control
- Advocated for individual control over personal data

2. Types of Data and Rights
- Distinguished between public "information commons" (like Wikipedia) and private personal data
- Emphasized data protection as protecting people, not just information
- Called for recognition of individual data rights

3. Predictions and Outcomes
Many of the article's warnings proved prescient:
- Data breaches continued and escalated (e.g., Equifax 2017, Facebook/Cambridge Analytica 2018)
- Tech company power over personal data grew substantially
- Behavioral prediction and control through data became more sophisticated
- The need for stronger data protection became widely recognized (leading to GDPR in 2018)

However, some aspects developed differently:
- The term "surveillance capitalism" emerged as a more widely adopted framing than "digital feudalism", though both describe similar power dynamics of data control
- Individual control over personal data remains limited despite regulatory efforts
- The "digital enlightenment" called for hasn't yet materialized

## Connections to *The Atomic Human*

The article's themes resonate with several key ideas developed in the book:

1. Power Structures and Control
- The medieval feudalism metaphor connects to the book's exploration of how power operates through technological systems
- Early articulation of concerns about prediction and control that develop into the book's concept of "System Zero"
- Warns about concentration of power that the book later examines through multiple historical lenses

2. Personal Data and Privacy
- Introduces distinction between public and private data that the book explores more deeply
- Raises questions about individual agency that become central to the book's analysis
- Highlights vulnerability of personal data that the book examines through multiple case studies

3. Institutional Responses
- Article calls for a "digital enlightenment" to protect individual rights
- Book develops this theme further by examining various institutional approaches to maintaining human agency in technological systems
- Both emphasize need for systemic rather than just technical solutions

The article represents an early warning about data control and human agency that *The Atomic Human* would later explore in much greater depth, showing how these concerns evolved from specific issues around data privacy to broader questions about human autonomy in technological systems.
