## **Background: AI Council (2018–2023)**

The **AI Council** was an independent advisory group providing insights into AI policy for the **UK Government**. From **2022–2023**, it focused on the **policy implications of Large Language Models (LLMs)**, offering recommendations to secure national capability and address societal risks.

### **Key Contributions:**

- **AI Council Overview:** [AI Council Archive](https://mlatcl.github.io/projects/ai-council/)
- **Large Language Models Opportunity Memo (Dec 2022):** [Memo PDF](https://mlatcl.github.io/papers/ai-council-llm-memo.pdf)
- **Foundation Models Policy Paper (Apr 2023):** [Policy Paper PDF](https://mlatcl.github.io/papers/ai-council-foundation-models-policy-paper.pdf)

## **AI Council Key Publications**

### **1. Large Language Models Opportunity (Dec 2022)**

- Advocated **national and sovereign capability** in LLMs to prevent dependency on foreign companies and mitigate vulnerabilities.  
- Recommended **investment in compute resources**, **R&D infrastructure**, and **public-private partnerships**.  
- Outlined **potential use cases** in **education**, **healthcare**, and **cybersecurity** while stressing the need for **responsible regulation**.  
- [Read Full Memo](https://mlatcl.github.io/papers/ai-council-llm-memo.pdf)

### **2. Foundation Models Policy Paper (Apr 2023)**

- Proposed a **two-pronged strategy**:  
  1. **AI Policy Frameworks** – Create governance systems for safe AI development and deployment.  
  2. **National Infrastructure** – Establish **AI proving grounds** (similar to NASA) to test and refine AI models before rollout.  
- Focused on **collaboration with industry, academia, and international allies** to build an adaptive AI policy approach.

### **Commentary: The NACA Model and the 5 Ps Framework**

#### **NACA Model Overview**

The policy paper proposes an **AI proving ground** inspired by the **National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA)**—a precursor to **NASA**. This approach emphasizes:  
1. **National profile** – A central hub for AI testing and development.  
2. **Separation of roles** – Focused on **testing and refining** technologies rather than building them.  
3. **Tight integration of research and practice** – Bridging **academia, industry, and government** to solve deployment challenges.  

### **Connections to *The Atomic Human***  
- *The Atomic Human* explores **technological dependence** and the need to **preserve human agency**.  
- The NACA model mirrors this by creating a **structured process** to test and **evaluate AI tools**, ensuring alignment with **human values** before deployment.  
- Both emphasize **systems thinking**, where AI is integrated into society through **collaboration and checks** rather than unrestricted growth.

### **Alignment with the 5 Ps Model**  

| **5 Ps**         | **Connection to NACA Model**                                                                                      |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**      | The proving ground embodies a **clear purpose**: ensuring AI advances serve **national security** and **public good**. |
| **People**       | Engages **diverse experts**—scientists, policymakers, and industry leaders—reflecting the **interdisciplinary focus** of *The Atomic Human*. |
| **Projects**     | Focuses on **actionable goals** like testing AI capabilities, setting standards, and piloting deployment scenarios. |
| **Principles**   | Emphasizes **responsible innovation**, aligning with the book’s call for **ethical frameworks** and **transparency**. |
| **Process**      | Uses an **adaptive approach**—testing, learning, and iterating—consistent with the book’s view of AI as a **continuous evolution**. |
