title: "Endorsement by General Mark A. Milley"
extract: >
  Neil Lawrence’s The Atomic Human is a brilliant technological and philosophical tour de force by one the world’s foremost authorities on the world of AI and machine learning. Anyone interested in the great promise and potential dangers of AI and machine learning would do well to read this book. The Atomic Human is at once fascinating, entertaining, and a deeply serious study on one of the most consequential emerging technologies humans have ever developed. Lawrence has plenty of computer science laced through the book, but he makes it understandable to the non-specialist by great use of historical examples and explanation by analogy. It is also a book of ethics and philosophy that argues we must always ensure that machines and AI are viewed and used as tools to assist humans and we must never concede control of fundamental decisions of great consequence. A great book by an obviously brilliant author.
