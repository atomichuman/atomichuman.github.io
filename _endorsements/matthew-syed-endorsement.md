title: "Endorsement by Matthew Syed"
extract: >
  According to Professor Neil Lawrence, all of us suffer from locked-in syndrome ... I have been gripped by this insight. Lawrenceâ€™s book concludes that whatever AI becomes, and whether or not it ultimately poses a threat to our species, it will never replicate or penetrate the essence of what it means to be human ... To be a human is, indeed, to be locked in. But it is in our struggle against inarticulacy that we find our deepest voice and highest meaning.
