title: "Endorsement by David Auerbach"
extract: >
  The Atomic Human is a brilliantly panoramic celebration of the vast expanses of human cognition, as well as the ingenious, flawed, and often bizarre attempts to replicate it artificially. Refusing easy answers, Neil Lawrence cuts a huge swath across the history of computation with passion, erudition, skepticism, and hope.
