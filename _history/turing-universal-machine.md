### Summary

Alan Turingâ€™s concept of the Universal Machine, introduced in his 1936 paper *On Computable Numbers*, laid the theoretical foundation for modern computing. The Turing Machine demonstrated that a single machine could simulate the logic of any computational algorithm, given the right inputs and programming. This revolutionary idea bridged mathematics and engineering, paving the way for digital computers and the development of artificial intelligence.
