### Historical Context

The Post Office Horizon scandal represents one of Britain's most severe miscarriages of justice. Beginning in 1999, the Post Office implemented Fujitsu's Horizon IT system to manage transactions across its network. Over the following two decades, hundreds of sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted for theft and fraud based on system errors. Despite evidence of software faults, the Post Office maintained aggressive prosecution, leading to bankruptcies, imprisonments, and several suicides. While some convictions were overturned in 2019, as of 2024 many victims still await compensation and full exoneration.

### Relationship to The Atomic Human

The Horizon scandal exemplifies several key themes from the book:

#### System Zero and Automated Decision-Making

The scandal demonstrates the dangers of System Zero - automated systems making consequential decisions without adequate human oversight [Chapter 8](/chapters/08-system-zero/). Like the Harrow drug trial example, it shows how systemic interventions can have devastating unintended consequences when deployed without full understanding.

#### Trust and Power Asymmetries
The Post Office's behavior mirrors the institutional gaslighting described in [Chapter 10](/chapters/10-gaslighting/), where power structures exploit human vulnerability and trust. The victims' experiences parallel the East German citizens facing the Stasi - individuals confronting an unaccountable system that denies their lived reality.

#### Model-Blinkers and Institutional Failure
The Post Office's rigid adherence to Horizon's data demonstrates the "model-blinkers" concept [Chapter 10](/chapters/10-gaslighting/), where institutional commitment to a theoretical model overrides human evidence and experience. This connects to broader discussions of how paradigm shifts require generational change.

#### Human-Analogue Machines
The case highlights risks discussed in [Chapter 11](/chapters/11-human-analogue-machines/) about deploying flawed automated systems in consequential domains. Like the autonomous vehicle accidents described, Horizon's errors had devastating real-world impacts that human oversight might have prevented.

#### Digital Oligarchy
The scandal exemplifies the dangers of digital oligarchy discussed in [Chapter 12](/chapters/12-trust/), where institutions wielding technological power become unaccountable to those affected by their decisions. The ongoing struggle for justice demonstrates why human agency and institutional accountability must be maintained in technological systems.

The Horizon scandal thus serves as a real-world validation of the book's warnings about automated decision-making and institutional power, while emphasizing the human cost when these systems fail.
