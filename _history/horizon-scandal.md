### Summary

The Horizon scandal involved the Post Office’s faulty Horizon IT system, which led to wrongful accusations of theft and fraud against hundreds of UK sub-postmasters. Spanning two decades, the scandal exposed the dangers of over-reliance on flawed automated systems and the lack of accountability in their implementation. The event highlighted the human cost of technological errors and underscored the need for transparency and ethical oversight in system design and deployment.
