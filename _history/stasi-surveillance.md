### Summary

The Stasi, the secret police of East Germany, maintained one of the most extensive surveillance operations in history, monitoring millions of citizens. Through informants, wiretapping, and psychological manipulation, the Stasi sought to suppress dissent and control society. This era highlights the dangers of intrusive surveillance and the long-term social fractures caused by mistrust, betrayal, and the loss of privacy.
