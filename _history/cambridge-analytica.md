### Historical Context

Cambridge Analytica emerged from the intersection of academic psychometric research and political consulting. The company built on research from Cambridge University's Psychometrics Centre about predicting personality traits from Facebook activity. By 2016, the company had harvested data from over 87 million Facebook users through a personality quiz app, exploiting Facebook's permissive data-sharing policies. This data was used to create detailed psychological profiles for targeted political messaging, notably during the 2016 Brexit referendum and U.S. presidential election. The scandal broke in 2018 through whistleblower Christopher Wylie, leading to investigations, Facebook being fined $5 billion by the FTC, and increased scrutiny of digital platforms' data practices.

### Relationship to The Atomic Human

The Cambridge Analytica scandal exemplifies several key themes from the book:

#### System Zero and Manipulation
[Chapter 8](/chapters/08-system-zero/) uses Cambridge Analytica as a prime example of System Zero - automated systems that exploit human psychological vulnerabilities. Their targeting system demonstrates how personal data can be weaponized for social manipulation.

#### Digital Oligarchy
The case illustrates themes from [Chapter 3](/chapters/03-intent/) about how Facebook's FBLearner system enabled unprecedented scale of social manipulation. Cambridge Analytica exploited the digital oligarchy's concentration of personal data and algorithmic power.

#### Trust and Power Asymmetries
[Chapter 12](/chapters/12-trust/) connects the scandal to broader questions about trust in digital systems. The betrayal of user trust mirrors earlier examples like the Stasi, showing how surveillance powers enable social control.

#### Human Vulnerability
The effectiveness of psychometric targeting, discussed in [Chapter 10](/chapters/10-gaslighting/), demonstrates human susceptibility to manipulation through data. Like institutional gaslighting, it exploits our social nature and limited communication bandwidth.

#### Information Coherence
The company's methods relate to discussions in [Chapter 4](/chapters/04-persistence/) about how cultural context shapes human behavior. Their success came from systematically exploiting patterns in how humans process and respond to information.

Cambridge Analytica thus serves as a crucial case study in how modern technology enables unprecedented manipulation of human psychology through data. It validates the book's warnings about the need for appropriate constraints on automated systems that affect human agency.
