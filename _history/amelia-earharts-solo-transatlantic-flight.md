### Historical Context

Amelia Earhart's solo transatlantic flight in May 1932 saw her pilot a single-engine Lockheed Vega 5B from Harbor Grace, Newfoundland to Culmore, Northern Ireland in 14 hours and 56 minutes. She contended with strong northerly winds, mechanical problems, and ice damage to her aircraft. A defective altimeter and gasoline leak added to the challenges. Rather than landing in Paris as planned, she was forced to make an emergency landing in a pasture in Northern Ireland, becoming the first woman and second person to fly solo across the Atlantic.

### Relationship to The Atomic Human

The flight features in the book as a key example of human adaptation to uncertainty:

#### Dead Reckoning and Drift
[Chapter 7](/chapters/07-its-not-rocket-science/) uses Earhart's navigation methods to explain concepts of dead reckoning and drift. Without modern navigation aids, she had to constantly estimate her position based on initial calculations, compass heading, airspeed, and wind effects - demonstrating human capacity for maintaining orientation under uncertainty.

#### Fast-Reacting Reflexive Systems
Her handling of mechanical problems during the flight exemplifies themes from [Chapter 7](/chapters/07-its-not-rocket-science/) about how trained reflexes handle immediate challenges while the reflective mind tackles longer-term navigation issues. The interplay between these systems was crucial for survival.

#### Interpolation vs Extrapolation
[Chapter 6](/chapters/06-the-gremlin-of-uncertainty/) contrasts her experience-based decision making with modern computational approaches. Like test pilot Stefan Cavallo's encounters with weather, her flight showed how human pilots learn to handle conditions that defy simple prediction.

#### Trust and Verification
The flight's challenges, particularly the faulty altimeter, relate to discussions in [Chapter 12](/chapters/12-trust/) about the critical relationship between trust and verification in human-machine systems. Her experience shows how pilots learned to cross-verify instrument readings against other cues.

Earhart's transatlantic flight thus serves as a vivid example of human capability to handle uncertainty through combined use of training, experience, and judgment - themes that would later become crucial in the space program and modern automated systems.
