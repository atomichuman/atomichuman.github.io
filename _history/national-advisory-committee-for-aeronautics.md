### Historical Context

The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) was established in 1915 to coordinate American aeronautical research. From its Langley Research Center in Virginia, NACA pioneered systematic approaches to aircraft testing and development. The organization developed fundamental advances in aerodynamics, including the NACA airfoil series that revolutionized wing design. NACA's methodical approach to flight testing helped transform aviation from a dangerous experimental field into a reliable technology. In 1958, NACA was absorbed into the newly created NASA, bringing its culture of systematic research and practical innovation to the space program.

### Relationship to The Atomic Human

NACA features prominently in the book through several key narratives:

#### Uncertainty and Experience
Through Stefan Cavallo's story in [Chapter 6](/chapters/06-the-gremlin-of-uncertainty/), NACA exemplifies how human pilots learned to handle uncertainty through direct experience. Cavallo's encounter with cumulonimbus clouds demonstrates the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical understanding that NACA's test pilots had to bridge.

#### Fast and Slow Systems
[Chapter 7](/chapters/07-its-not-rocket-science/) uses Bob Gilruth's NACA research on pilot handling qualities to explore the interaction between fast reflexive responses and slower reflective thinking. This work helped establish how human pilots could effectively control increasingly complex aircraft.

#### Human-Machine Interface
NACA's approach to flight testing, detailed in [Chapter 11](/chapters/11-human-analogue-machines/), shows how organizations can effectively combine human judgment with technical measurement. Their work helped establish principles for human-machine interaction that would later inform the space program.

#### Institutional Learning
The organization's evolution from aircraft to spacecraft testing, referenced in [Chapter 7](/chapters/07-its-not-rocket-science/), demonstrates how institutions can effectively accumulate and transmit knowledge. This connects to broader themes about how human intelligence emerges from cultural context.

#### Trust and Common Purpose
NACA's culture of methodical testing and shared expertise, highlighted through Cavallo and Gilruth's stories, exemplifies themes from [Chapter 12](/chapters/12-trust/) about the importance of trust in complex organizations.

NACA thus serves as an example of how organizations can effectively integrate human experience with technological advancement, maintaining appropriate balance between systematic measurement and practical judgment. Their approach contrasts with later examples where organizations lost this balance in pursuit of full automation.
