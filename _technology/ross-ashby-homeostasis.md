### Summary

W. Ross Ashby’s work on homeostasis and cybernetics was foundational in understanding how systems adapt to maintain stability in changing environments. His book *Design for a Brain* introduced the concept of adaptive mechanisms in machines, drawing parallels to biological systems like the human brain. Ashby’s ideas influenced the fields of control theory, artificial intelligence, and systems thinking, emphasizing the importance of feedback and adaptation in complex systems.
