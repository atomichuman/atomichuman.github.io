### Summary

The foundations of neural networks were laid in 1943 by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in their seminal paper *A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity*. They proposed a computational model of the brain, demonstrating how neurons could be represented as simple binary units to perform logical operations. This groundbreaking work introduced the concept of artificial neural networks, forming the basis for modern machine learning and artificial intelligence.
