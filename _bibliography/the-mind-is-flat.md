### Machine Summary

Chater challenges the common perception that our minds have hidden depths, arguing instead that human consciousness is more improvisational than we realize. He suggests that rather than accessing pre-existing thoughts and feelings, we create them in the moment through interaction with our environment.

In *The Atomic Human*, this work is referenced in Chapter 10 in discussions about how humans construct meaning and make decisions. Chater's ideas about the improvised nature of human consciousness help explain why artificial intelligence systems, which rely on stored patterns and fixed algorithms, differ fundamentally from human intelligence.
