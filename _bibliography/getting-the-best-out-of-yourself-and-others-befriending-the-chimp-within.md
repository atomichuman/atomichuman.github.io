title: Getting the best out of yourself and others â€“ befriending the Chimp within
abstract: |
  By understanding the mind and how it works we can learn how to operate it to advantage. This skill can lead to a better quality of life and to improved personal and professional relationships, confidence and improved self-esteem. By utilising emotional skills we can increase the probability of success in areas such as business and sport. Steve Peters will share some of the experiences where this has taken place and offer some take home points for the audience to use themselves.

  Professor Steve Peters is a consultant psychiatrist, Undergraduate Dean at Sheffield Medical School and Honorary Graduate of The University of Sheffield, where students voted him Best Clinical Teacher. His specialist interest is in the working of the human mind; he is the author of The Chimp Paradox, the best-selling, mind-management book. His Mind Management Programme has been successfully applied in a number of Team GB Olympic and Paralympic sports, professional sports and, more recently, in business and education.
