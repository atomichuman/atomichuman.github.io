### Machine Summary

Gibson's influential work introduces the concept of affordances and presents an ecological approach to perception. He argues that animals (including humans) directly perceive meaningful aspects of their environment through action and interaction, rather than constructing internal representations from sensory data.

This ecological approach to perception resonates with themes in *The Atomic Human*, particularly in discussions of sensorimotor intelligence and active sensing. The concept of affordances helps explain how intelligence emerges from interaction with the environment rather than from abstract computation alone.
