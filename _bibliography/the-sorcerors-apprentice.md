### Summary

Goethe's "Der Zauberlehrling" (The Sorcerer's Apprentice) tells the story of a magician's apprentice who, in his master's absence, attempts to use magic to make his chores easier. He enchants a broom to carry water, but lacking the full knowledge to control the spell, he creates chaos as the broom multiplies and floods the workshop. Only the return of the master sorcerer saves the situation.

In *The Atomic Human*, this poem serves as a crucial metaphor in the Epilogue, where it illustrates the current situation with technology companies. Like the apprentice, these companies have unleashed powers they cannot fully control, creating systems of such complexity that no individual fully understands them. The story helps frame the book's argument about the need for institutional engagement and careful governance of artificial intelligence, rather than letting technology run unchecked.
