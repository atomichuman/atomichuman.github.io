### Summary

George Orwellâ€™s novel *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, published in 1949, explores themes of surveillance, control, and the erosion of truth in a totalitarian regime. The concept of Big Brother and the manipulation of information resonate with modern concerns about privacy and the misuse of data in the digital age. The novel serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the dangers of unchecked power and the fragility of individual freedoms.

In *The Atomic Human* the book is used to bridge into the surveillance techniques of the Stasi, illustrating how fiction can become reality. One irony is that Vera Legnsfeld had read the book while she was being betrayed by her husband Knud. The antidote to the centralised approach of the Stasi is later highlighted in the epilogue which introduces Karl Popper's The Open Society and its Enemies.
