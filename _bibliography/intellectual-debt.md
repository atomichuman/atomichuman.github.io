### Summary

Zittrain introduces the concept of "intellectual debt" - the gap between our ability to use AI systems and our understanding of how they work. He argues that as AI systems become more powerful and ubiquitous, this knowledge gap creates significant societal risks and responsibilities.

In *The Atomic Human*, Zittrain's concept of intellectual debt is referenced in discussions of how organizations and societies delegate decision-making to automated systems they don't fully understand. This relates particularly to the book's themes about the risks of ceding human agency to black-box AI systems and the importance of maintaining meaningful human control over consequential decisions.
