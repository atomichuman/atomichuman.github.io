  A landmark volume in science writing by one of the great minds of our time, Stephen Hawking's book explores such profound questions as: How did the universe begin—and what made its start possible? Does time always flow forward? Is the universe unending—or are there boundaries? Are there other dimensions in space? What will happen when it all ends?

### Machine Summary

Hawking's "A Brief History of Time" appears in *The Atomic Human* primarily in discussions about [embracing doubt](/themes/embracing-doubt) and the [evolution of scientific thought](/themes/evolution-of-scientific-thought). In [Chapter 6: The Gremlin of Uncertainty](/chapters/06-the-gremlin-of-uncertainty), the book is referenced when exploring how even our most fundamental scientific theories contain inherent uncertainties - much like the quantum mechanics that Hawking describes.
