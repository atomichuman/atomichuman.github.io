### Machine Summary

Galton's influential work attempts to demonstrate that mental capabilities are inherited, introducing statistical methods to study human differences. The book laid groundwork for both the field of behavioral genetics and the controversial eugenics movement.

In The Atomic Human, Galton's work is referenced in the Epilogue when discussing historical attempts to measure and categorize human intelligence. It serves as a cautionary example of how scientific approaches to understanding human potential can be misused to support harmful social policies.
