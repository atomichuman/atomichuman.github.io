### Machine Summary

Sara Lyons examines how Victorian literature, particularly the Bildungsroman (coming-of-age novel), engaged with emerging scientific and social theories about human intelligence and potential. The book explores how these literary works both reflected and challenged contemporary debates about intelligence testing, education, and social mobility during a pivotal period in British history.

In The Atomic Human, this work is referenced in the context of discussions about the historical development of intelligence testing and its relationship to social control and eugenics. It helps establish the historical context for how society has attempted to measure and categorize human potential.
