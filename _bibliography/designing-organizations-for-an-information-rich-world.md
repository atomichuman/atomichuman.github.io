  DADDARIO. I was attracted to participate in this series by the appropriate- ness of the theme, Computers, Communications, and the Public Interest. Perhaps the title of the present session should be "Designing Organizations for an Information-Rich, Communications-Poor, Problem-Overwhelmed World." If anything characterizes the current age, it is the complex prob- lems of our technological civilization and the unpleasant physical and mental trauma they induce. John W. Gardner and other social critics warn us that a nation can perish from internal strains: indifference, unwillingness to face problems, incapacity to respond to human suffering, failure to adapt to new conditions, and the waning energy of old age. Gardner speaks of the "waxwork of anachronisms" in government and the "impenetrable web of vested interests" in unions, professions, universities, and corporations. He argues for "a society (and institutions) capable of continuous change, continuous renewal, and continuous responsiveness."
  I see no room for complacency by the growing community devoted to communications and information processing in the face of the obvious needs of our society. Today we exchange a growing proportion of knowledge in new ways: via magnetic tapes, remote consoles wired to computers, national and international information networks, and large data banks.
  Expansion is so rapid, it is hard to document what is happening ...

## Machine Commentary

Herbert Simon's ideas in the 1971 lecture, "Designing Organizations for an Information-Rich World," offer a wealth of conceptual influence that may have shaped the themes in "The Atomic Human." Below are some key points that likely resonated:

### 1. **Scarcity of Attention in an Information-Rich World**
Simon introduces the idea that while the availability of information has dramatically increased, attention—the ability to process and act on that information—has become the scarcest resource. This concept could directly influence "The Atomic Human" by framing human cognition and decision-making as critical bottlenecks in an age of overwhelming information. The atomicity of humans—breaking them down into fundamental units—may metaphorically parallel Simon's attention units, emphasizing streamlined and focused cognitive processes.

### 2. **Reframing Definitions and Cognitive Processes**
Simon discusses how terms like "thinking," "information," and "memory" have evolved to take on precise meanings in scientific contexts. This redefinition could inspire narrative or conceptual elements in "The Atomic Human," focusing on a transformation of what it means to be human in an era where these cognitive processes are augmented or mediated by technology.

### 3. **Information Processing as the Core of Human Systems**
Simon emphasizes that information processing is central to human activity and organizations. In "The Atomic Human," this might translate to a portrayal of humans as fundamentally data-processing entities, interconnected and possibly reengineered for efficiency in line with technological systems.

### 4. **Experimentation and Feedback Loops**
Simon advocates for experimentation and continuous feedback mechanisms to address unforeseen challenges, stressing that inaction also carries risks. This perspective could shape a narrative where humans, augmented by technology, adapt dynamically to an ever-changing environment, symbolizing a feedback-driven evolution.

### 5. **Optimism Towards Technology**
Simon's optimism about technology as a means to escape human limitations aligns with themes in speculative fiction like "The Atomic Human," where advancements often create new forms of human potential and capability, albeit sometimes at a cost.

### 6. **Overcoming Overload through Filtering and Indexing**
Simon's idea that intelligent filtering systems can manage information overload may inspire depictions of technological or cognitive enhancements in "The Atomic Human." These enhancements could serve as tools for distilling vast amounts of data into actionable insights, reflecting the selective processes Simon describes.
