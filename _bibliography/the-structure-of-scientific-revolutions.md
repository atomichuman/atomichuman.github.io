### Machine Summary

Kuhn's landmark work introduces the concept of paradigm shifts in scientific thinking, arguing that science does not progress linearly but through revolutionary changes in how scientists see and understand the world. The book fundamentally changed our understanding of how scientific knowledge develops.

In *The Atomic Human*, Kuhn's ideas about paradigm shifts and the role of textbooks in normalizing scientific understanding are extensively referenced in Chapter 10. His concept of "model-blinkers" - how established paradigms can restrict thinking - is used to explain historical resistance to new ideas in physics and potential parallels in artificial intelligence development.
