The film depicts a future where Skynet, an AI defense system, becomes self-aware and initiates a war against humanity. The Terminator, a relentless robotic assassin, serves as a powerful symbol of unbridled technological advancement and its potential dangers. The movie has become a cultural icon, shaping public perceptions of AI and sparking discussions about the ethical limits of automation and machine autonomy.

The terminator image is widely used in society as a headline for stories about AI. Ironically, it's even used in one of the reviews for this book. In Chapter 1 The terminator is used alongside the image of God in [Michelangelo's Sistine chapel](/history/Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel/) as a route to describing how we view intelligences as embodied, later described as anthroxing.
