  A theory of affordances is outlined according to which affordances are relations between the abilities of animals and features of the environment. As relations, affordances are both real and perceivable but are not properties of either the environment or the animal. I argue that this theory has advantages over extant theories of affordances and briefly discuss the relations among affordances and niches, perceivers, and events.

### Machine Summary

Chemero develops a relational theory of affordances, arguing that they exist as relationships between animal abilities and environmental features rather than properties of either alone. This perspective helps resolve philosophical debates about the nature of affordances while maintaining their practical utility.

This work connects to *The Atomic Human*'s discussions of the "affordance gap" between human and machine capabilities, particularly in chapters dealing with human-analogue machines (HAMs) and the fundamental differences between biological and artificial intelligence. Chemero's relational view helps explain why simply mimicking human behavior doesn't capture the full nature of human intelligence.
