abstract: |
  These imaginative thought experiments are the inventions of one of the world's eminent brain researchers. They are "vehicles," a series of hypothetical, self-operating machines that exhibit increasingly intricate if not always successful or civilized "behavior." Each of the vehicles in the series incorporates the essential features of all the earlier models and along the way they come to embody aggression, love, logic, manifestations of foresight, concept formation, creative thinking, personality, and free will. In a section of extensive biological notes, Braitenberg locates many elements of his fantasy in current brain research.

### Machine Summary

Braitenberg presents a series of thought experiments involving simple mechanical vehicles that exhibit increasingly complex behaviors. Through these "vehicles," he demonstrates how seemingly intelligent behaviors can emerge from simple mechanisms. The book is foundational in synthetic psychology and robotics.

In *The Atomic Human*, this work is extensively referenced in Chapter 5, particularly through the concept of "Braitenberg's law" and the "Braitenberg squid." These ideas are used to explore how simple feedback mechanisms can create behaviors that appear intelligent, helping to bridge the gap between mechanical and biological systems in our understanding of intelligence.
