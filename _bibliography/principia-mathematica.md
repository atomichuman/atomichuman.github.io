### Machine Summary

The Principia Mathematica represents a monumental attempt to derive all mathematical truths from purely logical principles. This three-volume work laid crucial foundations for mathematical logic and the philosophy of mathematics, though its ultimate goal of reducing mathematics to logic proved unattainable.

In *The Atomic Human*, this work appears in Chapter 5's discussion of the development of mathematical logic and its influence on computing. The authors' attempt to create a complete logical foundation for mathematics relates to later discussions about the limitations of purely logical approaches to artificial intelligence and human reasoning.
