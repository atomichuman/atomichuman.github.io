Today's reflection builds on where we got to in 2016 with sharing data science approaches. A reminder of context, I was worried about the increasing power of a *digital oligarchy* (see my comment in this panel, this article in the Guardian and how the book deals with it).

I'd seem my African colleagues start to construct a [ground up initiative Data Science Africa](/initiatives/data-science-africa-ii).

I was advocating for what I called [Open Data Science](/archive/open-data-science-initiative/).

Given all that it seems a strange move to up sticks, leave academia and join Amazon.
