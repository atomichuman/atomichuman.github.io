One consistent misrepresentation I hear around AI, particularly from those who are creating it is "no one understands this technology". 

Strictly speaking it might be true, but only in the same way that "no one understands Microsoft Word" or "no one understands how a Ford Focus works". 

These systems are very complex, but even for simple systems this is true. Most people aren't aware that to initiate a right turn on a bicycle you first turn the wheel left.[^1]

[^1]: This is to maintain balance, to make a right turn the bike needs to lean to the right for balance, but to lean a bike to the right you have to turn left. So even though most of us aren't aware of it we naturally make a small left turn before we turn right to get the bike's lean correct.

This leads to a suspicion that what people really mean by "no one understands this technology" is "it's really poorly designed". 

We don't need to know how a car or a bicycle works to learn how to drive or ride them. We need the technology to perform in a predictable manner that responds to our interventions.

In *The Atomic Human* I try to avoid using terms like consciousness or sentience that are poorly defined. But I do use the word "feel" a lot in a way that isn't very well defined. I'm using this word in the sense of "getting a feel for something" but it has a different sense as in "search your feelings Luke", or when something makes us "feel bad". 

I think the most relevant word here is [*affordances*](/themes/affordances/). The book focuses on constraints (or limitations) of human intelligence that in combination with our environment change our affordances. 

In the ITV dramatisation of the Horizon scandal, spoken by the actor playing Jo Holloway, who was wrongfully imprisoned based on faulty data from the system, says that she doesn't understand whether the Post Office were incompetent or evil.
