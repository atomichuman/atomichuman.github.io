I once participated in a round table discussion on liberalism.[^1] The two main debaters were an early career political historian and a very established behavioral economist. I was excited to listen, because although I'm an instinctive supporter of democratic institutionalism, the young political historian challenging and interesting ideas that she presented in a provocative way. I'd learned a lot from her in the conversations we've had.

[^1]: As in [classical liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism). 

The debate was disappointing because the behavioural economist failed to engage with any of the points the political historian made. Although they were never rude, I felt their style of discussion, which verbally acknwoledged the points but intellectually never engaged was somewhat disdainful. 

For me this also came across as a lack of respect for the young political historian's perspective, and whether I was right or not, this lack of respect irritated me to the extent that later the same day when the behavioural economist gave a public speech I entered the room in somewhat of a contrarian mood. 

So whatever the behavioural economist then said, I was minded to pick holes in it. The speaker's style was somewhat sardonic, and at some point they wheeled out the idea that "of course everyone in this room thinks they're better than the average academic". The speaker was referring to the phenomenon of [*illusory superiority* or the *above average effect*](/bibliography/are-we-all-less-risky-and-skillful-than-our-fellow-drivers/). In the original paper the authors described how most drivers think they are more skillful or less risky than the average driver and suggested that this was an illusion because there's no way that the majority can be better than the average (assuming the form of average selected is the median).

<i>Different academics might prioritise different qualities. To rank them these qualities need to be projected down to a one dimensional space. With different projections we can all be better than average.</i>

In my contrarian mood, I realised why this statement is misleading. There is no first principles definition of what it means to be a "good academic", just like there's no first principles definition of what it means to be a good driver or a to be intelligent. Each of us is entitled to hold a subjective opinion about what the important characteristics are. Under our subjective weightings of the different importance of these characteristics it is possible, likely even, that we are each better than average. Because we are each likely to be working towards our own subjective ideal. 

I call this phenomenon the subjectivity of superiority.
