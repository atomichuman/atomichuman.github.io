I once participated in a round table discussion on liberalism.[^1] The two main debaters were an early career political historian and a very established behavioral economist. I was excited to listen, because although I'm an instinctive supporter of democratic institutionalism, the young political historian challenging and interesting ideas that she presented in a provocative way. I'd learned a lot from her in the conversations we've had.

[^1]: As in [classical liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism). 

The debate was disappointing because the behavioural economist failed to engage with any of the points the political historian made. Although they were never rude, I felt their style of discussion, which verbally acknwoledged the points but intellectually never engaged was somewhat disdainful. 

For me this also came across as a lack of respect for the young political historian's perspective, and whether I was right or not, this lack of respect irritated me to the extent that later the same day when the behavioural economist gave a public speech I entered the room in somewhat of a contrarian mood. 

So whatever the behavioural economist then said, I was minded to pick holes in it. The speaker's style was somewhat sardonic, and at some point they wheeled out the idea that "of course everyone in this room thinks they're better than the average academic". The speaker was referring to the phenomenon of [*illusory superiority* or the *above average effect*](/bibliography/are-we-all-less-risky-and-skillful-than-our-fellow-drivers/).
