The recent Draghi report on The Future of European Competitiveness bemoans the innovation gap between the US and China and Europe. One part of the analysis looks how how the gap in productivity and innovation between the US and Europe has widened since the 1990s. Draghi suggests that this is because Europe has missed out on the digital economy.

The Draghi report considers how Europe's competetiveness needs to be improved in the next wave of the digital revolution. One motivation for improved productivity is economic growth which typically leads to greater prosperity and political stability. But looking across at the US we see that despite their greater productivity, they face political instability and insecurity about their global role at levels not seen since before the second world war.  

When I was at Amazon, my colleague Narayan Venkatasubramanian, a supply chain guru, told me the story of the last 150 years in suppply chain. Across the nineteenth and first half of the 20th century, manufactured goods were in short supply. If you could make it people would buy it. Profits were made by controlling the means of production. Manufacturing was the bottleneck in supply chain and therefore the source of economic value.

After the second world war, manufacturing capacity increased. As this the bottleneck shifts from our ability to produce to our ability to consume. We are faced with overwhelming choice. The economic value is now made by controlling demand instead of controlling supply.

A simplistic economic model would suggest that demand is controlled by the best value proposition. But in practice there is a further bottleneck we need to consider. As we considered in [spiritual animals](/reflections/spiritual-animals), human attention in limited. When we have an abundance of information, our attention becomes the bottleneck. 

Our limited communication ability lies at the core of the Atomic Human. And our intelligence (both individual and cultural) has evolved ways through which we are selective in choosing which information to focus on. 

Because the bottleneck is consumption, and the route to that consumption is through our attention, companies are economically incentivised to capture our attention. The historic challenge in achieving this is what the American department store magnate, John Wanamaker, was referring to when he says "Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which half."[^1]
