The recent Draghi report on The Future of European Competitiveness bemoans the innovation gap between the US and China and Europe. One part of the analysis looks how how the gap in productivity and innovation between the US and Europe has widened since the 1990s. Draghi suggests that this is because Europe has missed out on the digital economy.

The Draghi report considers how Europe's competetiveness needs to be improved in the next wave of the digital revolution. One motivation for improved productivity is economic growth which typically leads to greater prosperity and political stability. But looking across at the US we see that despite their greater productivity, they face political instability and insecurity about their global role at levels not seen since before the second world war.  

When I was at Amazon, my colleague Narayan Venkatasubramanian, a supply chain guru, told me the story of the last 150 years in suppply chain. Across the nineteenth and first half of the 20th century, manufactured goods were in short supply. If you could make it people would buy it. Profits were made by controlling the means of production. Manufacturing was the bottleneck in supply chain and therefore the source of economic value.

After the second world war, manufacturing capacity increased. As this the bottleneck shifts from our ability to produce to our ability to consume. We are faced with overwhelming choice. The economic value is now made by controlling demand instead of controlling supply.

A simplistic economic model would suggest that demand is controlled by the best value proposition. But in practice there is a further bottleneck we need to consider. As we considered in [spiritual animals](/reflections/spiritual-animals), human attention in limited. When we have an abundance of information, our attention becomes the bottleneck. 

Our limited communication ability lies at the core of the atomic human. And our intelligence (both individual and cultural) has evolved ways through which we are selective in choosing which information to focus on. 

Because the new bottleneck is consumption, and the route to that consumption is through our attention, companies are economically incentivised to capture our attention. This phenomenon is known as the "attention economy".[^1]

[^1]: See [Spiritual Animals](/reflections/spiritual-animals) for details on this.

The historic challenge in achieving this is what the American department store magnate, John Wanamaker, was referring to when he says "Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which half."[^2] 

[^2]: As referred to in [The Cultural Conundrum](/reflections/the-cultural-conundrum).

Today, the advertisers no longer face Wanamaker's quandary. Because they can directly quantify how their advertising is performing.[^3] The emergence of [System Zero](/themes/system-zero)[^4] is a consequence of this.

[^3]: I first commented on this emerging phenomenon for an article in the Guardian from July 2015. You can see a commentary on this article [here](/archive/data-driven-economy-marketing-2015). 

[^4]: Covered in [Chapter 8 of *The Atomic Human*](/chapters/08-system-zero).

This is leading to what I call the "attention capture cycle". Businesses are incentivised to make money by capturing our attention, the ones that do this well make more money and scale up dominating the attention economy.

And this gets back to the fundamental challenge that isn't addressed by the Draghi report. The attention capture cycle leads to a form of digital feudalism where the attention economy is dominated by a few large companies. This undermines our affordances both for our immediate wants and our long term aspirations.[^5]

[^5]: See [Bridging from Domain Experts to AI Capability](/reflections/bridging-from-domain-experts-to-ai-capability) for more on this.

In a recent Financial Times Opinion piece, I highlighted that the challenge we face is that as we automate more our wants and aspirations become harder to quantify in the modern supply chain. This explains why in our public dialouges we receive a clear message about the type of solutions individuals want.[^6] But in terms of delivery both large tech companies and small start-ups have failed to make significant progress on these challenges.

[^6]: Broadly speaking this is advances in education, healthcare, social care, security, and better individual empowerment. See [Art is Human](/reflections/art-is-human) and [this retrospective on Royal Society Public Dialogue](/archive/royal-society-ml-working-group-public-dialogue/).

These are the [*wicked problems*](/themes/wicked-problems) that require a more sophisticated approach than the current innovation economy is allowing for. 

So what is the solution? The Draghi report argues for various interventions at the level of the EU. Similar considerations can be given in the UK to address these issues. But as I try to acknowledge, as academics and universities, we need to do a beter job of stepping up. The initiatives we've reviewed, [Data Science Africa](/initiatives/data-science-africa-i/), [Accelerate Science](/initiatives/accelerate-science/), the [Data Trusts Initative](/initiatives/data-trusts) and [ai@cam](/initiatives/ai-cam/) have varying purposes and projects underpinning them. But they share a common philosophy. It is an *attention reinvestment cycle*.

Each initiative shares at least some of the following principles:

1. Agility. Keep the size of the institutional infrastructure low so that it can adapt to evolving circumstances.
2. Share credit. It's amazing what you can achieve if you don't care who gets the credit. 
3. Scaling Human Capital. Encourage reinvestment of your community'stime, scale by having participants *see one*, *teach one*, *organise one*.
4. Bidirectional learning. Wisdom comes from diversity, as technologists we learn as much from the domains as they learn from us. 

Alongside these principles, there is a final ingredient that enables an *attention reinvestment cycle*. Chapter 11 of *The Atomic Human* describes the notion of the *Human Analogue Machine*[^7]. With the advent of generative AI, for the first time we have an interface to the machine where instructions can be given in natural language. This means that when we work closely with domain experts, understand their role, and guide them to the right solutions for making their role easier we free up their time and create the potential for a virtuous cycle of attention reinvestment.

[^7]: See [The Human Analogue Machine](/chapters/11-the-human-analogue-machine) for more on this.

The *attention reinvestment cycle* leverages these principles to reinvest time savings through automation into the sharing of how those time savings were made. Not by "technical experts" but by nurses, doctors, teachers, local planning officers, what Karl Popper would call the "piecemeal social engineers". 

By reinvesting time directly, rather than returning financial savings, we can ensure that the innovation economy focusses on the challenges that those individuals are prioritising, rather than the attention-capture priorities of our current innovation economy.

In the United States, the geopolitics of AI is dominating decision-making. With the large tech companies seen as the main defence against autocracy. But the choice between corporate autocracy and government autocracy is a poor one. As the Draghi report emphasises, the challenge for Europe (and the UK) is to bring the benefits of these technologies in ways that reflect our values. Values that can be traced to Popper's defence of the Open Society. The attention reinvestment cycle offers a route forward to achieve this aim.
