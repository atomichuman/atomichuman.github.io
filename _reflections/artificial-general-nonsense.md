Sometimes you get asked if there's anything you'd change about the book, or anything you got wrong in the book. Well, I don't think the book is perfect, but I think that its flaws are my flaws. And I like that. But, while giving talks about the book I sometimes talk about things in a slightly different way.

I've become more polemic about some issues and I think that reflects the way in which techno-hype has drawn society into some very dangerous ways of thinking.

I turn up to many book tooks with my Brompton bicycle. Embarassingly I even took it to Google which is only a 30 second walk from King's Cross station. That made me realise it's become a sort of security blanket. I like having it because it's such a flexible means of transport.

But is it an "artificial general vehicle"? A vehicle that can do everything? Unfortunately not, for example it's not very good for flying to the USA. There is no artificial general vehicle that is optimal for every journey. Similarly there is no such thing as artificial general intelligence. It's just artificial general nonsense.

That doesn't mean there aren't different principles to intelligence we can look at. Just like vehicles have principles that apply to them. When designing vehicles we need to think about air resistance, friction, power. We have developed solutions such as wheels, different types of engines and wings that are deployed across different vehicles to achieve different results. 

Intelligence is similar. The noation of artificial general intelligence is fundamentally eugenic. It builds on Spearman's term "general intelligence" which is part of a body of literature that was looking to assess intelligence in the way we assess height. The objective then being to breed greater intelligences.[^1]

[^1]: See [Sara Lyon's book *Assessing Intelligence*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctv32vqk1h) for an overview of the context and the social reactions at the time. 

So why has a conversation about one of the most socially transformational technologies in human history collapsed into artificial general nonsense? 

There is a heavy commercial incentive, the technosolutionism of Sillicon Valley has now conflated with the simplistic thinking of Wall Street investment. Under their simplistic ideas of intelligence there is money to be made and a "market to be cornered". The market values of big tech are now predicated on the idea that they will develop something that doesn't exist.[^2]

[^2]: Even if it were possible to build a general purpose superintelligence wouldn't a world where one or two companies were owning that capability be distopian?

Intelligence, like a vehicle, is contextual. Our intelligence is adapted to who we are and how we interact with each other. It is a general purpose intelligence, not a general intelligence. It has weaknesses and strengths. It cannot dominate in all aspects. It is social, and requires us as individuals to share vulnearabilities and have skin in the game. 

It is also adaptive and it's going to have to be, because while the idea of artificial general intelligence is eugenic nonsense, this technology is utterly transformational. It requires new ways of thinking and managing society. It's urgent that we engage the wider population in understanding how to use it and ensuring its supporting them in their roles. We need to move rapidly beyond artificial generla nonsense we are hearing and towards common sense.
