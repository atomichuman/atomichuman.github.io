<!-- Consider moving Wanamaker quote later, after establishing context for AI and culture -->

Organisations looking to adapt to the challenges of AI face difficult decsions about how to assimialte the technology. Remember this is a technology that can access information three hundred million times faster than we can. That's the difference betwen walking pace and light speed. Such a disruptive technology is revolutionising our information landscape. 

Alongside this information landscape, our human cultures provide intellectual landscapes that assist us in making decisions. They contain ideas, practices, principles, purposes and processes. But the radical change in the information landscape necessitates a similar change in our intellectual landscape.[^1]

[^1]: In *The Atomic Human* culture is seen as a way of setting the context in which we operate. Culture provides an intellectual landscape as well as agreed unpon approaches for delivery that means we can co-operate without constantly communicating. The purposes, principles and processes embedded in our human culture are bequeathed to us across  generations of empirical validation as a set of practices. The original purpose becomes lost in time, but the lack of purpose does not invalidate the practice.

The three case studies we've looked at so far, [Data Science Africa](/initiatives/data-science-africa-i/), [Accelerate Science](/initiatives/accelerate-science/) and the [Data Trusts Initiative](/initiatives/data-trusts/) each have different purposes and contexts leading to different sets of principles and processes that underpin the emerging cultures for these nascent institutions. 

Existing businesses and institutions also face challenges in these shifting landscapes. Some aspects of the organisational culture will be intrinsic to how the organisation operates. Those aspects encode their purpose, principles and processes. They are critical to the organisation's ability to survive and thrive. But other aspects will be holding the organisation back and undermining its ability to adapt to these evolving circumstances. 

These organisations face a similar quandry to one that the American department store magnate John Wanamaker expressed when considering his marketing budget. He is supposed to have said:

> Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which half.

Established organisations face the same cultural quandry: which half? In their search for answers they even turn to academics like me for help. As a result I now do a lot o executive education. 

"You need to change your organisational culture" I tell them.

"But how?" they ask.

There are two ways that we can interpret that question, "What changes are needed in my orgqanisations culture?" or "What are the steps necessary to change an organisations culture?" Fortuantely we can give the same answer to both these questions.

In Data Science Africa and Accelerate Science both initiatives started with a blank slate in terms of culture. Both resisted inheriting existing culture. This meant that they could grow rapidly and develop new principles and processes that are better adapted to the new information landscape.

<!-- Consider merging this with previous paragraph for better flow -->

 When we start with a blank slate we can develop new culture quickly, but when we are operating with existing practices it can be hard to decide what to change and how to change it. 

<!-- Consider providing specific examples of anachronistic practices -->

This form of cultural wisdom contains many lessons, but our information topography will be so disrupted by the machine - remember it can share information 300 million times faster than we can - that many of our current cultural practices may prove anachronistic. 

<!-- Good contrast with previous initiatives - consider highlighting this more clearly -->

When it comes to the Data Trusts Initiative, a different approach had to be taken because the purpose requires close engagement with existing cultural and institutional practices. By its nature the initiative is trying to learn from existing institutions and build on the manner in which they protect our vulnerabilities. Unlike the other two initiatives which could plant a flag and launch a rallying call that builds a coalition of the willing, the data trusts initiative needs to carry existing structures with it to be successful. The unwilling cannot be ignored they need to be understood and accommodated in the underlying principles.

<!-- Consider combining these two short paragraphs -->

How different organisations respond to the challenges presented by AI disruption depends on where they are on this spectrum. Is this a brand new inititiative that can define its culture? Or does it need to evolve existing cultures?

<!-- Typo: 'inititiative' should be 'initiative' -->

This is why start-ups find it easy to disrupt, like DSA the can form a new culture and assimilate new capabilities more rapidly. Ironically this causes large organisations to believe that they simply need to adopt "start up culture" and all will be well. 

<!-- Strong connection back to opening quote - consider expanding on this parallel -->

But this is where we get back to John Wannamaker's quandry. For an established organisation half of the culture is holding it back, but half of the culture is critical to its ability to thrive and survive. The answer to the quandry is the answer to the cultural conundrum. As with any challenge of uncertainty, you need your eyes and ears open to how events are evolving in practice. That means you need a structure that is capturing that understanding across your organisation. You need the mechanisms of feedback that [we also see as critical to establishing the affordances of your people](/reflections/bridging-from-domain-experts-to-ai-capability/). You need to avoid the trap of centrally imposed solutions that led to the Horizon and Lorenzo scandals. You need to empower your people and listen to the problems they are having and the projects they have to fix them. 

<!-- Consider stronger concluding paragraph that ties together main themes -->

<!-- Typo: 'quandry' should be 'quandary' -->

The trick to solving the culture conundrum is to ensure your culture absorbs the information it needs for the organisation to adapt and to ensure that the individuals in the organisation are empowered to bring about the necessary change.
