Across the three case studies we've looked at so far, Data Science Africa, Accelerate Science and the Data Trusts Initiative there's been one lurking lever that has led to the very different characters of each initiative. That is culture.

Since the advent of AI, I do a lot of executive education. Business people want answers. What do they need to do to lead their organisations forwad in the presence of this disruptive technology. Unfortunately the right answer is also the hardest to address. You need to change your organsiational culture. "How?" is the response. And there are  two ways we can look at that question, the first is in what ways do I need to change my organisations culture and the second is how do I go about changing it?\
\
So far we've looked at three initiatives, Data Science Africa, Accelerate Science and the Data Trusts Initiative. The trick to the speed of deployment and growth of the first two initiatives is that they both started with a blank slate in terms of organisational culture. While the had purposes and objectives, both initiatives have had the freedom to convene the people who believe in the vision. That allows them to set new priorities and ways of working. The processes, purpose and principles that lead to a new culture.\
\
In \*The Atomic Human\* culture is seen as a way of setting the context in which we operate. Culture provides an intellectual landscape as well as agreed unpon approaches for delivery that means we can co-operate without constantly communicating. The purposes, principles and processes embedded in our human culture are bequeathed to us across  generations of empirical validation as a set of practices. The original purpose becomes lost in time, but the lack of purpose does not invalidate the practice. When we start with a blank slate we can develop new culture quickly, but when we are operating with existing practices it can be hard to decide what to change and how to change it. \

This form of cultural wisdom contains many lessons, but our information topography will be so disrupted by the machine - remember it can share information 300 million times faster than we can - that many of our current cultural practices may prove anachronistic. The situation is reminiscient of John Wanamaker's quote regarding his marketing budget: "Half of the money I spend on marketing is wasted, the question is which half".
