How long did it take you to write? The answer is now visualised below.

Versions of the book from when I started until today are visualised in this YouTube video.

The visualisation tool uses a half second per day, so now I can finally say that the material was edited on around 550 days across eight years with the initial repository created on GitHub on 21st May 2015.
