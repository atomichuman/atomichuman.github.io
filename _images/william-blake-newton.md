William Blake’s *Newton*, an iconic print of the scientist immersed in geometric calculations, is used in *The Atomic Human* to explore the duality of human intelligence. While Blake critiques the dominance of rationality and logic at the expense of imagination, Neil D. Lawrence uses this image to highlight the limitations of mechanistic approaches to intelligence, such as those in artificial intelligence systems.

The print serves as a reminder of the uniquely human blend of creativity and analytical thought. Lawrence contrasts this with the narrow, task-oriented focus of AI, emphasizing that true intelligence encompasses both the rational and the imaginative. Blake’s portrayal of Newton hunched over his calculations also echoes broader themes of embodiment and the constraints on human thought, reinforcing the book’s exploration of what separates human intelligence from artificial constructs.
