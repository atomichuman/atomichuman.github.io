Dan Andrews runs <https://scribeysense.com>. We've worked with him a lot as a graphical scribe for many [ai@cam](https://ai.cam.ac.uk) and [Accelerate Science](https://science.ai.cam.ac.uk) events. 


I think the image is referring to one of the running themes of the chapter, which is around my [grandfather's story](people/fred-lawrence) on the run in to D-Day alongside the story of [Tommy Flowers](people/tommy-flowers) and the creation of [Colossus](technology/colossus). In both cases they operated autonomously, making different decisions to what they were told to do. And those decisions turn out to be linked in terms of the timing of D-Day.
