Dan Andrews runs <https://scribeysense.com>. We've worked with him a lot as a graphical scribe for many [ai@cam](https://ai.cam.ac.uk) and [Accelerate Science](https://science.ai.cam.ac.uk) events. 

I asked him if he would mind reading the book and drawing what inspired him. One drawing for each chapter. This is what he picked out from Chapter 1.
