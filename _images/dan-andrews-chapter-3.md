Dan Andrews runs <https://scribeysense.com>. We've worked with him a lot as a graphical scribe for many [ai@cam](https://ai.cam.ac.uk) and [Accelerate Science](https://science.ai.cam.ac.uk) events. 


This image sets the context of our intelligence emphasising how we overcome the embodiment factor.
