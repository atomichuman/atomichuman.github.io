<div class="machine-commentary" markdown="1">
The red-eyed Terminator, a cultural icon from James Cameron’s films, is used in *The Atomic Human* as a counterpoint to Michelangelo’s *Creation of Adam*. Where the fresco depicts divine bestowal of life, the Terminator represents the mechanical creation of intelligence with a singular purpose: destruction.  

Neil D. Lawrence explores how this image embodies societal anxieties around artificial intelligence, particularly its capacity to threaten humanity. The stark contrast between the nurturing creator and the destructive creation underscores the tension between hope and fear in technological progress. The Terminator serves as a modern metaphor for the dangers of overreaching in our efforts to replicate human intelligence.
