This image of Michelangelo's *The Creation of Adam* is used in *The Atomic Human* to contrast divine and mechanical creation, emphasizing our limited communication bandwidth and the embodied nature of intelligence. It illustrates humanity’s inherent tendency to anthropomorphize intelligence, both divine and artificial.

Neil D. Lawrence uses this iconic image to frame discussions on what makes human intelligence unique, exploring themes of embodiment and communication constraints. The fresco serves as a symbol of human aspiration and cultural shifts—both during the Renaissance and in today’s age of AI innovation.
