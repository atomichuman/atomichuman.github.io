  Computer scientist Neil Lawrence has worked on machine learning for more than 20 years at universities and technology companies: experiences that illuminate his views on intelligence in this demanding but fascinating debut book. Its title draws on the concept, proposed by the philosopher Democritus, that matter cannot be reduced beyond atoms. Lawrence argues that human intelligence is also atomic. “Although not a believer, I have sympathy with the idea that there is a spirit within us that cannot be replaced by a machine.”
