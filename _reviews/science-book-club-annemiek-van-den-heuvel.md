  This book is my top pick for 2024. Itâ€™s so insightful that I wish it were mandatory reading in schools or universities. Reading it made me reflect on how much easier my cognitive science studies in the '90s would have been if this book had existed. I highlighted over 2,000 passages, took 400 notes, and added five books to my reading list thanks to it.
