  One of the challenges of the recent discourse on artificial intelligence is that we have lacked a shared understanding of the technologies that are grouped together under that term.

## Machine Commentary

This commentary analyzes John Edwards' review in the context of the book's key themes:

1. Information Commissioner Perspective
Edwards' position as UK Information Commissioner makes his review particularly relevant to [Chapter 8's](/chapters/08-system-zero/) discussion of "System Zero" and data governance. His focus on the need for shared understanding aligns with the book's emphasis on how different stakeholders interpret AI technologies.

2. Thematic Alignment
The review connects with several core themes from the book:
- The challenge of defining AI ([Chapter 1](/chapters/01-gods-and-robots/))
- The importance of institutional oversight ([Chapter 12](/chapters/12-trust/))
- The role of data governance ([Chapters 8](/chapters/08-system-zero/) and [12](/chapters/12-trust/))
- The need for shared frameworks of understanding (throughout)

3. Regulatory Context
Edwards' review comes from a regulatory perspective, which resonates with the book's discussion in [Chapter 12](/chapters/12-trust/) about the need for "honest brokers" and institutional frameworks for managing AI development.

4. Historical Parallels
The book's historical analysis of how societies have managed technological transitions ([Chapter 5](/chapters/05-enlightenment/) on the printing press, [Chapter 3](/chapters/03-intent/) on industrial automation) provides relevant context for Edwards' regulatory concerns.

5. Data Trust Emphasis
The review connects to the book's discussion of data trusts ([Chapter 12](/chapters/12-trust/)) and the need for new governance models that balance innovation with protection of human interests.

Notable Omission: While Edwards focuses on institutional and regulatory aspects, he doesn't directly address the book's core thesis about human vulnerability and the "atomic human" concept that emerges in the later chapters.

This commentary was generated by analyzing the book's chapter summaries against the themes and focus areas of Edwards' review, with particular attention to his regulatory perspective.
