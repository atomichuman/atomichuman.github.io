Here's a summary of Chapter 3: Intent

Key themes:

1. Personal Experience and Expert Systems:
- Author describes work as field engineer measuring rock formations
- Observes how geologists make complex decisions based on context and experience 
- Attempts to capture expertise in logical rules reveals limitations of expert systems
- Shows gap between human judgment and automated decision-making

2. Logic and Decision Making:
- Contrasts Sherlock Holmes's deductive logic with real-world complexity
- Explains why logic-based expert systems failed in 1980s
- Demonstrates need for context and judgment beyond pure rules
- Shows limitations of complete information requirement

3. Machine Learning Emergence:
- Describes shift from expert systems to machine learning approaches
- Author transitions from oil industry to AI research
- Shows how neural networks offered new way to capture expertise
- Explains difference between programmed rules and learned patterns

4. Facebook's Information Infrastructure: 
- Details Joaquin Candela's development of FBLearner system
- Contrasts continuous deployment with centralized planning
- Shows how automated decision-making scaled to billions
- Reveals vulnerabilities of automated systems to manipulation

5. Risks and Manipulation:
- Describes how Internet Research Agency exploited Facebook
- Details Cambridge Analytica scandal and data privacy concerns
- Shows dangers of delegating decisions to algorithms without context
- Explains concept of "digital oligarchy" and its lack of control

The chapter demonstrates how automated decision-making has evolved from simple expert systems to complex machine learning infrastructures, while highlighting the risks of removing human judgment and context from these systems.
