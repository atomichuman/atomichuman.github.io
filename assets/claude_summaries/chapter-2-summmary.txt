Here's a summary of Chapter 2: Automatons

Key themes:

1. Information Flow and Military Command:
- Follows Fred Lawrence (author's grandfather) during D-Day preparations
- Explores how military command structures handle information flow
- Contrasts centralized command with devolved authority
- Introduces concept of "information topography" - how information moves through organizations

2. Decision Making and Authority:
- Compares Eisenhower's military command to Bezos's corporate leadership at Amazon
- Explains how large organizations must devolve authority while maintaining control
- Uses bicycle riding analogy: leaning back provides stability but reduces direct control
- Shows how culture and shared values enable devolved decision-making

3. Origins of Automated Decision-Making:
- Traces development at Bletchley Park during WWII
- Details how human "computers" like Diana Russell-Clarke processed information
- Explains development of mechanical computers to automate code-breaking
- Shows how tasks requiring pure logic could be automated, while judgment remained human

4. Cryptography and Information Processing:
- Describes German Enigma machine and Allied code-breaking efforts
- Explains concepts of "cribs" (educated guesses) in breaking codes
- Shows how work was broken down into automated and human components
- Introduces mathematical concepts behind encryption and computing

5. Machine vs Human Intelligence:
- Contrasts rigid automation with flexible human judgment
- Shows how early computers were purpose-built for specific tasks
- Explains how complex problems were broken down into smaller automatable parts
- Establishes distinction between tasks requiring judgment versus pure computation

The chapter demonstrates how modern AI and automated decision-making have roots in WWII code-breaking efforts, while highlighting the historical divide between tasks that could be automated and those requiring human judgment.
