Here's a summary of Chapter 7: It's Not Rocket Science or Brain Surgery

Key Themes:

1. Fast vs Slow Decision Making:
- Opens with bicycle accident story showing distinction between reflexive (fast) and reflective (slow) reactions
- Demonstrates how retrospective narrative creates illusion of conscious control
- Explains how time pressure forces reliance on reflexive systems
- Shows how memory reconstructs events differently from real-time experience

2. Devolved Decision Making:
- Compares nervous system to Mission Control's hierarchy of decision making
- Shows how different decisions are delegated to different parts of system based on time pressure and context
- Explains "Eisenhower illusion" - feeling of control despite actual devolution of decisions
- Demonstrates how reflexes bypass conscious thought for speed

3. Motor Intelligence:
- Describes evolution of motor control systems
- Shows how practice and training tune reflexive responses
- Explains role of spine and interneurons in coordinating movement
- Highlights gap between human/animal and machine motor capabilities

4. Apollo Program and Human-Machine Interaction:
- Details development of Apollo guidance computer
- Shows balance between automated systems and human control
- Describes critical moment when computer overloaded during moon landing
- Demonstrates importance of both human judgment and automated systems

5. Integration of Systems:
- Shows how reflexive and reflective systems work together
- Explains role of culture in shaping both fast and slow responses
- Demonstrates how training and simulation prepare both humans and machines
- Highlights importance of both individual achievement and collaborative effort

The chapter uses the moon landing and bicycle accident as parallel examples to explore how human intelligence emerges from interaction between fast reflexive systems and slower reflective thinking, while highlighting the crucial role of training and cultural context in shaping both types of response.
