Here's a summary of the Prologue:

The book opens at a pivotal moment in December 2013 at the Neural Information Processing Systems conference in Nevada, when the field of machine learning began transforming into "artificial intelligence." During a meeting in Mark Zuckerberg's penthouse suite, Facebook announced its plans to establish an AI research lab under Yann LeCun, following a breakthrough in computer vision using deep learning that had been acquired by Google.

The author notes this marked a significant shift, as the term "artificial intelligence" had previously been associated with failed logical reasoning approaches rather than the more successful machine learning techniques. The announcement came as Facebook sought to catch up with Google in the AI race, with Google soon after acquiring DeepMind for $500 million.

The author views this moment as the beginning of a major transformation in his field. The conference grew from 2,000 delegates in 2013 to 13,000 by 2019, reflecting the explosive growth of AI's importance in society. Many of his academic colleagues, including Zoubin Ghahramani and Max Welling, moved into senior industry roles at major tech companies, and he himself spent time leading an Amazon machine learning division.

The prologue raises key questions about the nature of intelligence and artificial intelligence, suggesting that like Henry Ford's customers asking for "a faster horse," we might be mistakenly thinking of AI in terms of "a smarter human." The author indicates he prefers the term "machine intelligence" to avoid the cultural baggage associated with "artificial intelligence."

The passage establishes the author as an insider who witnessed firsthand the transformation of machine learning into modern AI, setting up an exploration of what intelligence really means and how this shapes our understanding of artificial intelligence.

ere's a summary of Chapter 1: Gods and Robots

This chapter explores the fundamental differences between human and machine intelligence through several key themes:

1. Human Communication Limitations:
- Humans have severely limited communication bandwidth compared to machines (humans can share ~2,000 bits/minute vs machines' 60 billion bits/minute)
- This creates a "locked-in" state similar to Bauby's diving bell analogy, where our thoughts are free but our ability to share them is constrained
- The author introduces the "embodiment factor" - the ratio between computational ability and communication ability

2. Different Forms of Intelligence:
- Questions the notion of "superintelligence" and one-dimensional views of intelligence
- Compares intelligence to Top Trumps card game - different types have different strengths and weaknesses
- Discusses distributed intelligence (like ant colonies) vs centralized intelligence (like human brains)
- Explores examples like Amazon's supply chain AI and immune systems as different forms of intelligence

3. Human Intelligence Characteristics:
- Relies heavily on cultural context and shared understanding for communication
- Involves constant "second-guessing" of other humans due to communication limitations
- Tends to anthropomorphize and embody other forms of intelligence (like God in the Sistine Chapel or the Terminator)

4. AI Development and Society:
- Traces automation from printing press to modern AI
- Notes how public fascination with AI often conflates intelligence as a property vs an entity
- Discusses potential benefits and risks of AI deployment in society
- Questions whether there's an "atomic" core to human intelligence that can't be replicated by machines

5. Future Implications:
- Argues for using AI as a mirror to better understand human intelligence
- Emphasizes need to balance technological progress with human needs
- Suggests focusing on practical applications rather than science fiction scenarios

The chapter sets up the book's exploration of human intelligence through the lens of artificial intelligence, aiming to understand what makes us uniquely human in an age of increasing automation.

of scaphandre would be an old-fashioned diving suit, one of the type
that Tintin and Captain Haddock used during their hunt for Red Rack-

3 Common sense would say that a machine that does nothing is not a
machine at all. But machines and mathematics don’t share in our
‘sense of the common’, so defining the nothing machine turns out to
be important to make everything work.

4 This is only partially true. At the time we were talking to Ferrari,
racing cars were using their engine’s exhaust to improve their aero-
dynamic performance in something called a ‘blown diffuser’. But the
effect of the blown diffuser could also be re-created in the model with-
out including a full engine.
5 In a Vernam cipher the two streams are compared. If the binary digits
are different, then the locked message encodes a 1. If they are the
same, the locked message gives a 0. The message then encodes ‘how it
was originally different’ from the key. If you have the key, and you
know how the original message was different from the key, then you
can decode the original message.
6 In the US such machines are known as Rube Goldberg machines after
a cartoonist who drew similar machines.

original German quote can be found in Moltke’s Militärische Werke: II.

4 Each brick is a chemical compound called a nucleobase. The four
nucleobases in DNA are called guanine, adenine, cytosine and thy-
mine and their first letters give us their representation as G, A, C and
T respectively.
5 This estimate is the current estimate of the mutation rate of the
human germline: see e.g. A. Scally, ‘Mutation rates and the evolution
of germline structure’, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of

7 Of course, this is just my subjective opinion. To properly rank these
two extraordinary achievements, I would have to convert the term
‘extraordinary’ into objective measures. One reason I find it more
extraordinary is because it is helpful in communicating the message of
this chapter to do so. So the objective measures I would be tempted to
create turn out to be subjective in origin.

3 The appointment lasted for only six weeks; Napoleon complained in
his memoir that Laplace didn’t see the subtleties of administration,
and Laplace was replaced with Napoleon’s brother. Perhaps the famil-
ial relationship of his replacement is a better explanation for the
replacement than Laplace’s administration skills.

8 In the United States, Benjamin Franklin is famous for his interest in
electricity. Some of Franklin’s experiments were conducted with Mat-
thew Boulton during visits to England in 1758 and 1760. The members
of the Lunar Society were socially liberal, making them kindred polit-
ical spirits to Franklin and the Founding Fathers of the US.

7. It’s Not Rocket Science or Brain Surgery
1 The first hominid in space was not a human but a chimpanzee named
Ham. He was used to test the survival systems of the Mercury cap-
sule. Yuri Gagarin became the second hominid to reach space when he
launched ten weeks later. See also Christopher Kraft, Flight: My Life in
Mission Control (Boston, MA: E. P. Dutton, 2001), p. 92. Kraft docu-
ments the origin of the expression ‘Spam in a can’ as coming from the
Society of Experimental Test Pilots.

4 After the war Cavallo was asked, like Chuck Yeager in The Right Stuff, to
go to Muroc air base to fly the X1. But as a father to a young family, with
his parents running a furniture business in New York, he turned
down the opportunity and headed back home to help in his parents’
business.
5 The term ‘unknown unknowns’ is often credited to Donald Rumsfeld
from a press conference in February 2002. But Kraft’s use of it predates
Rumsfeld’s: his autobiography was published in 2001.

conditioned reflex (or in every other physiological “business”) no
matter what it may look like outside, the business inside must be “staying
moderate”. So I am impelled to believe that the business outside is
matched by no change inside. The more the outer changes, the more
the inside doesn’t.’ Available from the W. Ross Ashby Digital Archive;

programming easier.

16 In Akkadian, names invoke gods and have meanings we can only
summarize in sentences. Negal was the god of war and plague;
Nergal-aha-iddina means ‘Nergal gave me a brother’. Today lots of
Hindi names share this characteristic, for example Subramanian
means ‘dear to Brahmam’, and Ramanujan means ‘younger brother
of Rama’.
17 Sin was the god of the Moon, and Sin-bununi means ‘Sin is our
goodness’.
18 Siyatu’s name is shorter, indicating that it’s either the shortening of a
longer name or a foreign name.
19 Adad was a god of storms. Adad-šuma-usur is ‘O Adad, safeguard the
offspring’.
20 ‘A gift of Yeho’, where Yeho is the name of a later Levantine god who
gained popularity from the Iron Age and eventually supplanted Jupiter
for the Romans.

2 The most important work on the theory of steam engines was pub-
lished by French engineer Sadi Carnot in 1824. Its title is Réflexions sur
la puissance motrice du feu, translated as Reflections on the Motive Power of
Fire, which reminds us nicely of the fact that for all its sophistication
the modern internal combustion engine is just a sophisticated way of
exploiting the motive power of fire.
