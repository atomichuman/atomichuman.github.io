In [The Cultural Conundrum](/reflections/the-cultural-conundrum) we reflected on the challenges of adapting existing culture to the disruptions of AI. The institutional approach at the University of Cambridge is our flagship mission on AI, [ai@cam](https://ai.cam.ac.uk/).

Cambridge has a long tradition of being at the cutting edge of machine learning, dating back to the 1980s and work in speech, language and computer vision. Today we enjoy the legacy of those achievements and a host of leading researchers, so why would we need a new initiative on AI? 

It's a good question, what would be the *purpose* of a new initiative at the University of Cambridge.[^1] Let's assume that the initiative *is* needed. Then another question arises. Why hasn't this initiative arisen naturally? Why do we need to intervene? 

[^1]: One can imagine that it might be useful to raise the profile of the work, or to attract more funding, and many initiatives are launched with these objectives, but in my experience such initiatives tend to lower thinking and increase politics.

Given these questions, instead of launching a new institute, we chose to explore what the aspirations of the University's AI researchers were and how we could suppot them. Across December 2021 to March 2022 we surveyed Cambridge's AI community and ran a series of workshops with staff from across the University, both academics and professional services. We reported with [a landscaping document](https://ai.cam.ac.uk/blog/ai-needs-to-serve-people-science-and-society) in April 2022. It captured Cambridge's aspirations:

- be a global leader in AI research, driving progress in technical domains,
applying AI to tackle major scientific and social challenges, and aligning
the development of AI technologies with societal interests;
— lead the field in AI education, training the next generation of AI leaders
and making AI accessible to all in society; and
— become an innovation hub, and a go-to source of advice, that connects
research, business, civil society, and policy leaders working to deploy AI
for wider social and economic benefit, shaping the development and
deployment of AI for the benefit of all in society. 

Identified enablers for those ambitions, and challenges that obstruct their achieval. For me those nine challenges are critical:

Table 1 Challenges in coordinating a new wave of progress in AI technologies across the University

Challenge
Bridging between the needs of challenge-driven applications and the focus of academically driven research

Question this poses
The next wave of progress in Al will be inspired by (or driven by) applications; how well prepared is Cambridge for this type of research?

Innovative solutions are often most easily developed at a small-scale, but achieving impact for these ideas requires the ability to scale-up (sometimes rapidly). What approaches to scaling the deployment of Al systems can help translate innovation to practice?

Hype surrounding Al progress contributes to a mismatch between expectations about its utility and technical capabilities in the field. What forms of engagement and communications can help overcome barriers to wider understanding of A''s capabilities?

Encompassing the pursuit of academic understanding over the long-term and the need for near-term and real time decision-making in deployment

Balancing the incentives that drive progress in Al outside academia and the incentives that shape individual academic's career progression

Accommodating the intellectual agility needed to follow new lines of investigation and the institutional inertia that influences how to pursue new research opportunities

Academic research typically proceeds at a different pace to decision-making in policy and private sector organisations. Connecting University expertise to this wider environment requires action to align these timescales. What interventions can support rapid deployment of academic expertise?

Progress requires cooperation and collaboration across sectors and communities, which in turn requires investment of time and energy from academics. How do we align collective needs with individual interests?

Effective research and teaching requires effective administration. How can the University manage its administrative functions to support agile, responsive and effective collaborations?
identified challenges we experience in achieving those aspirations.

The report showed that the University aspires to be a leading institution in the 

The question is one that not only Universities are facing. The Amazon Core ML team I joined in 2016 was set up to deliver machine learning solutions across the compnay, but there were already teams using cutting edge techniques in recommender systems, supply chain etc across the company. In government the deputy Prime Minister set up iAI, a centralised capability for deploying artificial intelligence across government, but there were already teams across government exploring these techniques in domains as broad as education and cybersecurity. How do we ensure that initiatives enhance existing capabilities rather than displacing them?

The approach we took for Cambridge was to push the question back to the community. We asked: What would be the purpose of a new initiative on AI at the University of Cambridge?

## Machine Commentary

*NL*: I'd like you to provide a "Machine Commentary" on how the initiative fits with the ideas in *The Atomic Human* and how its approach informed the ideas in the book.


*NL*: Can you provide further machine commentary on how ai@cam is fitting with the approach [described in this post](/reflections/purpose-people-projects-principles-process/)?
