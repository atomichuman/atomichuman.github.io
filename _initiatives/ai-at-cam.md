ai@cam is the University of Cambridge's flagship mission on AI. 

Cambridge has a long tradition of being at the cutting edge of machine learning, from Tony Robinson's recurrent neural networks applied to speech recognition to [Zoubin Ghahramani's](/people/zoubin-ghahramani) move to the Engineering Department from the Gatsby Unit at UCL making the University an international centre for work on Bayesian machine learning. Today is no exception, across the University we see the legacy of those achievements plus their modern equivalents. so why would we need a new initiative on AI?

It's a good question, what would be the *purpose* of a new initiative at the University of Cambridge. One can imagine that it might be useful to raise the profile of the work, or to attract funding, but these are purposes that tend to *lower* thinking and trigger politics. 

The question is one that not only Universities are facing. The Amazon Core ML team I joined in 2016 was set up to deliver machine learning solutions across the compnay, but there were already teams using cutting edge techniques in recommender systems, supply chain etc across the company. In government the deputy Prime Minister set up iAI, a centralised capability for deploying artificial intelligence across government, but there were already teams across government exploring these techniques in domains as broad as education and cybersecurity. How do we ensure that initiatives enhance existing capabilities rather than displacing them?

The approach we took for Cambridge was to push the question back to the community. We asked: What would be the purpose of a new initiative on AI at the University of Cambridge?

## Machine Commentary

*NL*: I'd like you to provide a "Machine Commentary" on how the initiative fits with the ideas in *The Atomic Human* and how its approach informed the ideas in the book.


*NL*: Can you provide further machine commentary on how ai@cam is fitting with the approach [described in this post](/reflections/purpose-people-projects-principles-process/)?
