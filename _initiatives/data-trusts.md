The first draft of *The Atomic Human* was wrtten in 2015.[^1] The last chapter was tentatively titled "A Data Democracy". It outlined a vision for a new type of institution, one that would rebalance the power asymmetry between data controllers and data subjects.

[^1]: Although it was a very different book, see [The Atomic Human](/reflections/triple-cooked/) for more details.

Prompted by challenges generated by the DeepMind-Royal Free Hospital data sharing agreement, I wrote about the proposal in an article for the Guardian in 2016.[^2] The idea of a data trust was to use the legal infastructure associated with trust law, that would be enforced by a court of equity,[^3] to enable a new type of instituion that could  provide governance based on the collectivised rights of data subjects.

[^2]: See this [archive piece](/archive/data-trusts-article-2016/) for more details.

[^3]: The Court of Equity is a court of law in England and Wales that deals with matters of trust and trust law. It is the successor to the Court of Chancery, which was established in the 14th century. Until 1400 the Court of Chancery mainly dealt with abuses of power in the feudal system. For a detailed history see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_equity_and_trusts).

Back in 2016 I wasn't aware of a phenonomen known as "trust-washing". Where the term "trust" is applied to an institution that borrows the terminology but isn't governed by a court of equity. For example, NHS Trusts are not governed by a court of equity so are not Trusts in the traditional sense.

Data protection law gives individuals a set of rights around their data. It also introduces the notion of a data-subject and a data-controller. The controller has responsibilities to the data subject in relation to those rights. In the last two posts we looked at *affordances* and a decomposition of x-risk into the components of *power concentration* and *automated decision making*. 

The interaction between our affordances, both immediate and aspirational, and the power concentration and automated processes behind lead to

## Machine Commentary

*NL*: I'd like you to provide a "Machine Commentary" on how the initiative fits with the ideas in *The Atomic Human* and how its approach informed the ideas in the book.


*NL*: Can you provide further machine commentary on how DSA is fitting with the approach [described in this post](/reflections/purpose-people-projects-principles-process/)?
