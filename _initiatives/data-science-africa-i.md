D﻿ata Science Africa had its first official meeting in 2015, but its roots go back further. Looking back it seems clear that the initiative started with the people.

J﻿ohn Quinn was a PhD student who I first met at NeurIPS in 2005, where he was publishing [on monitoring infants in neonatal intensive care](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2005/hash/aeefb050911334869a7a5d9e4d0e1689-Abstract.html). Once he had graduated he moved to Makerere University in Kampala,[^1] Fast forward another five years and inwe were together at a Dagstuhl Seminar, where I also met Ernest Mwebaze who was John's PhD student at the time.[^2] I was really struck by Ernest's work, he presented on an algorithm[^3] for Crop Surveillance that was implemented on $100 Android mobile phone.

[^1]: I didn't see John for a while, but I occasionally heard what he was doing, which was working with colleagues to build capability in Makerere's Computer Science department. John collaborated with the PASCAL2 European Network of Excellence [to deliver summer schools in Ghana in 2010 and 2011](https://k4all.org/african-adventures/). I remember Colin de la Higuera updating us on how it went. 

[^2]: This was [Dagstuhl Seminar 11341:Learning in the context of very high dimensional data](https://www.dagstuhl.de/seminars/seminar-calendar/seminar-details/11341). One of the organisers was Michael Biehl, his University, Groningen, were hosting Ernest for his PhD.

What struck me about Ernest's work was the scope of its ambition. The talk was about a learned vector quantisation algorithm, but the ambition was to place the algorithm in a farmer's hands in a field in Uganda. The work was in collaboration with Ugandan national crop surveyors. They were planning to go end-to-end from the farmer's field to the ministry of agriculture. It was the first time in machine learning that I'd seen someone attempting to bring all those components together.

At this point the purpose wasn't yet very well defined, I was impressed with Ernest and John's work and wanted to find out more.  John and Ernest were kind enough to invite me to Kampala for a research visit, I also suggested that we deliver some teaching while I was there. Two years later I visited John and Ernest with my PhD student [Ricardo](https://ric70x7.github.io/) to deliver a [short Gaussian process school](https://gpss.cc/gprs13/). This was our first project together.

The summer school attracted researchers from across Kampala, including some John and Ernest hadn't met before. We drove around Kampala visiting these new potential collaborators. One thing I really enjoy about the work there is on fundamentals. I don't mean fundamentals in terms of the mathematical properties of algorithms, but fundamentals in terms of what things work and what don't. There were lots of international projects in Kampala, and some (or many!) of them could seem quite clumsily implemented and harmful to local ecosystems.[^4]

I don't think I left Kampala with a purpose in mind, but I had some early ideas for ways of working with my Kampalan collaborators. We also left with a further project. My student Ricardo and John's PhD student [Martin Mubangizi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmubangizi/) would work together on malaria prediction. And the plan was to go from the Ugandan health centres to the Ugandan ministry of health. We had people and we had projects.
