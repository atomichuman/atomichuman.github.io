D﻿ata Science Africa had its first official meeting in 2015, but its routes go back further. \

J﻿ohn Quinn was a PhD student who I first met at NeurIPS in 2005. <https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2005/hash/aeefb050911334869a7a5d9e4d0e1689-Abstract.html> He was a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, and once he graduated he moved to Makerere University in Kampala. Fast forward another five years and inwe were together at [Dagstuhl Seminar 11341:Learning in the context of very high dimensional data](https://www.dagstuhl.de/seminars/seminar-calendar/seminar-details/11341)
