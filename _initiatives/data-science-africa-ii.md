One of the great privileges of academia is community. More importantly communities of achievement. I have friends and colleagues that do things that amaze me. And they are generous enough to share how they are doing them and then I find myself doing things I couldn't have imagined. Martin Mubangizi's visit to Sheffield came at a special time from a community perspective.[^0]

Our research group, ML@SITraN was spanning medicine and computer science, we had projects on computational biology, Gaussian processes and this emerging interest in open data science. I think the highlight of Martin's visit was when we had Fernando Perez and Fabian Pedregosa join us for a small workshop in April 2014.[^1] This was the relatively early days of Jupyter notebooks (then still called the IPython notebook) and `scikit-learn`. Fernando and Fabian were leading individuals in open source software. Two memories stand out for me, Fernando working with Martin showing him how interactive widgets could be used to visualise the spectral imaging data from Martin's malaria project. And Fabian talking about community building around open source projects. The importance of building the right sort of collaborative atmosphere.

[^1]: I'd met both Fabian and Fernando at the 2013 NeurIPS workshop on [Machine Learning and Open Source Softwre](https://mloss.org/workshop/nips13/). 

Martin also briefly overlapped with Ciira Maina. Ciira was originally from Nairobi, came to us from Drexel University with a background in speech recognition, but worked with us on analysis of genetic transcription[^2].
A large focus for the Sheffield group at the time was computational biology. One of our post-docs, Ciira came to us from Drexel with a background in speech recognition. By the time Martin visited Sheffield, Ciira was coming to the end of his post-doc and was looking for his next position. 

[^2]: As part of the EraSysBio+ project. Ciira's main work was analyzing Chromatin Immunioprecipitation data. See [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003598).

Ciira was keen to return to Kenya and build expertise there. When he told me he'd found a job at Dedan Kimath University of Technology, we agreed that after he'd had a chance to settle in we'd hold a meeting there. That was the first Data Science Africa meeting.[^3] The event was funded on a shoestring, I used consulting money from Ferrari to fly in instructors from Sheffield. Ciira got the support of his University for the lecture theatre.

[^3]: I've put archive details for that first meeting here: [Archive on Kenya meeting](/archive/data-science-africa-nyeri-2015/). 

[The meeting was structured around three days of summer school and two days of workshop](https://www.datascienceafrica.org/dsa2015/). The idea being to bring students up to speed with data science techniques, then show real-world examples of these techniques being deployed in practice.[^4]

[^4]: This approach was modelled on Gaussian process summer schools, which in turn were based on the idea that you build community by attracting more senior people to interact with the students. By ending with a workshop showcasing latest deployments you give students a chance to interact with people at the cusp of deployment.

Nyeri is within a 24 hour bus ride from Kampala, which gave us the chance to support a multi-national community. The second event [was planned for Kampala in 2016, with a workshop hosted by UN Global Pulse](https://www.datascienceafrica.org/dsa2016/). That event attracted attendees from Arusha in Tanzania, [Dina Machuve](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dina-machuve-74106266/) and [Neema Mduma](https://nm-aist.ac.tz/teams/dr-neema-mduma/) who kindly agreed to host [the third meeting at the Nelson Mandela African Institute of Science and Technology in 2017](https://www.datascienceafrica.org/dsa2017/). 

The approach was to attend one, teach one then organise one. All new organisers were paired with individuals who had experience of organising a previous meeting. By the time the pandemic struck the network had expanded into Ghana, Nigeria and Ethiopia. A succesful pattern was emerging and the next step was to consolidate it in ways that ensured the spirit of the organisation wasn't lost.

## Machine Commentary

*NL*: I'd like you to provide a "Machine Commentary" on how the initiative fits with the ideas in *The Atomic Human* and how its approach informed the ideas in the book.

*Claude*: Based on *The Atomic Human*, this initiative connects to several key themes:

1. Information Topography and Devolved Authority:
- Embraces "attend one, teach one, organize one" model that distributes knowledge and authority
- Builds local expertise rather than centralizing control
- Reflects book's emphasis on devolved decision-making over top-down control

2. Cultural Context and Information Coherence:
- Recognizes importance of local knowledge and context
- Builds community through shared understanding
- Mirrors book's discussion of how intelligence emerges from cultural interaction

3. Trust and Human-Analogue Interface:
- Creates trusted networks through personal connections
- Uses summer school format to build relationships
- Demonstrates book's emphasis on human relationships in technology transfer

4. System Zero Resistance:
- Empowers local communities to control their technological development
- Counters digital oligarchy by building independent expertise
- Reflects book's warning about concentrated technological power

5. Practical Implementation:
- Shows how universities can act as "honest brokers" in technological development
- Demonstrates bottom-up approach to building technological capability
- Exemplifies book's call for institutional engagement in AI development

The initiative appears to have informed the book's emphasis on human agency in technological development and its argument for distributed rather than centralized control of technological advancement.

*NL*: Can you provide further machine commentary on how Data Science Africa is fitting with the approach [described in this post](/reflections/purpose-people-projects-principles-process/)?

*Claude*: Looking specifically at how Data Science Africa evolved through the meetings described in data-science-africa-ii, we see the 5 Ps framework manifesting:

Purpose developed through practical implementation - the summer school and workshop format emerged as an effective way to build capability while connecting theory to practice.

People expanded organically across borders - from Kenya to Uganda to Tanzania, creating a network of expertise. The "attend one, teach one, organize one" approach ensured knowledge transfer while maintaining community values.

Projects remained grounded in practical application - the summer schools focused on building skills that could be immediately applied, while workshops showcased real-world implementations.

The expansion from Nyeri to Kampala to Arusha demonstrates how regional growth occurred through personal connections rather than top-down planning. Each new location brought in organizers who had previously participated, ensuring continuity of approach while adapting to local contexts.

The initiative maintained flexibility during growth - pairing new organizers with experienced ones provided informal process without rigid structure. This allowed the community to expand while preserving its essential character.

This evolution shows how grassroots initiatives can scale effectively by focusing on people and relationships while allowing formal processes to emerge gradually from practical experience.
