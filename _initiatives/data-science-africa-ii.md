One of the great privileges of academia is community. More importantly communities of achievement. I have friends and colleagues that do things that amaze me. And they are generous enough to share how they are doing them and then I find myself doing things I couldn't have imagined. Martin Mubangizi's visit to Sheffield came at a special time from a community perspective.[^0]

Our research group, ML@SITraN was spanning medicine and computer science, we had projects on computational biology, Gaussian processes and this emerging interest in open data science. I think the highlight of Martin's visit was when we had Fernando Perez and Fabian Pedregosa join us for a small workshop in April 2014.[^1] This was the relatively early days of Jupyter notebooks (then still called the IPython notebook) and `scikit-learn`. Fernando and Fabian were leading individuals in open source software. Two memories stand out for me, Fernando working with Martin showing him how interactive widgets could be used to visualise the spectral imaging data from Martin's malaria project. And Fabian talking about community building around open source projects. The importance of building the right sort of collaborative atmosphere.

[^1]: I'd met both Fabian and Fernando at the 2013 NeurIPS workshop on [Machine Learning and Open Source Softwre](https://mloss.org/workshop/nips13/). 

Martin also briefly overlapped with Ciira Maina. Ciira was originally from Nairobi, came to us from Drexel University with a background in speech recognition, but worked with us on analysis of genetic transcription[^2].
A large focus for the Sheffield group at the time was computational biology. One of our post-docs, Ciira came to us from Drexel with a background in speech recognition. By the time Martin visited Sheffield, Ciira was coming to the end of his post-doc and was looking for his next position. 

[^2]: As part of the EraSysBio+ project. Ciira's main work was analyzing Chromatin Immunioprecipitation data. See [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003598).

Ciira was keen to return to Kenya and build expertise there. When he told me he'd found a job at Dedan Kimath University of Technology, we agreed that after he'd had a chance to settle in we'd hold a meeting there. That was the first Data Science Africa meeting.[^3] The event was funded on a shoestring, I used consulting money from Ferrari to fly in instructors from Sheffield. Ciira got the support of his University for the lecture theatre.

[^3]: I've put archive details for that first meeting here: [Archive on Kenya meeting](/archive/data-science-africa-nyeri-2015/). 

[The meeting was structured around three days of summer school and two days of workshop](https://www.datascienceafrica.org/dsa2015/). The idea being to bring students up to speed with data science techniques, then show real-world examples of these techniques being deployed in practice.[^4]

[^4]: This approach was modelled on Gaussian process summer schools, which in turn were based on the idea that you build community by attracting more senior people to interact with the students. By ending with a workshop showcasing latest deployments you give students a chance to interact with people at the cusp of deployment.

Nyeri is within a 24 hour bus ride from Kampala, which gave us the chance to support a multi-national community. The second event [was planned for Kampala in 2016, with a workshop hosted by UN Global Pulse](https://www.datascienceafrica.org/dsa2016/). That event attracted attendees from Arusha in Tanzania, [Dina Machuve](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dina-machuve-74106266/) and [Neema Mduma](https://nm-aist.ac.tz/teams/dr-neema-mduma/) who kindly agreed to host [the third meeting at the Nelson Mandela African Institute of Science and Technology in 2017](https://www.datascienceafrica.org/dsa2017/). 

The approach was to attend one, teach one then organise one. All new organisers were paired with individuals who had experience of organising a previous meeting. By the time the pandemic struck the network had expanded into Ghana, Nigeria and Ethiopia. A succesful pattern was emerging and the next step was to consolidate it in ways that ensured the spirit of the organisation wasn't lost.

## Machine Commentary

*NL*: I'd like you to provide a "Machine Commentary" on how the initiative fits with the ideas in *The Atomic Human* and how its approach informed the ideas in the book.


*NL*: Can you provide further machine commentary on how DSA is fitting with the approach [described in this post](/reflections/purpose-people-projects-principles-process/)?
