ai@cam is the University of Cambridge's flagship mission on AI. Cambridge has always been at the cutting edge of machine learning, from Tony Robinson's recurrent neural networks applied to speech recognition to Zoubin Ghahramani's work on Bayesian machine learning. Today is no exception, so why do we need a flagship mission on AI?

Good question, and so when we were setting up ai@cam the first thing we did was to put that question to the community.

## Machine Commentary

*NL*: I'd like you to provide a "Machine Commentary" on how the initiative fits with the ideas in *The Atomic Human* and how its approach informed the ideas in the book.


*NL*: Can you provide further machine commentary on how DSA is fitting with the approach [described in this post](/reflections/purpose-people-projects-principles-process/)?
